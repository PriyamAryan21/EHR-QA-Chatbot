I had severe abdomen pain and was hospitalised for 15 days in ICU, diagnoised with CBD sludge thereafter on udiliv. Doctor advised for ERCP. My question is if the sludge was there does not the medication help in flushing it out? Whether ERCP was the only cure?

Brief Hospital Course:

During the ERCP a pancreatic stent was required to facilitate
access to the biliary system (removed at the end of the
procedure), and a common bile duct stent was placed to allow
drainage of the biliary obstruction caused by stones and sludge.
However, due to the patient's elevated INR, no sphincterotomy or
stone removal was performed. Frank pus was noted to be draining
from the common bile duct, and post-ERCP it was recommended that
the patient remain on IV Zosyn for at least a week. The
Vancomycin was discontinued.

On hospital day 4 (post-procedure day 3) the patient returned to
ERCP for re-evaluation of her biliary stent as her LFTs and
bilirubin continued an upward trend. On ERCP the previous
biliary stent was noted to be acutely obstructed by biliary
sludge and stones. As the patient's INR was normalized to 1.2, a
sphincterotomy was safely performed, with removal of several
biliary stones in addition to the common bile duct stent. At the
conclusion of the procedure, retrograde cholangiogram was
negative for filling defects.

Brief Hospital Course:

Acute diastolic heart failure: Pt developed signs and
symptoms of volume overload on [**2201-3-8**] with shortness of breath,
increased oxygen requirement and lower extremity edema. Echo
showed preserved EF, no WMA and worsening AI. CHF most likely
secondary to worsening valvular disease. He was diuresed with
lasix IV, intermittently on lasix gtt then transitioned to PO
torsemide with improvement in symptoms, although remained on a
small amount of supplemental oxygen for comfort.

Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for lethargy
and acidosis initially and was given 8 L on his presentation to
help maintain his BP's.  This undoubtedly contributed to his
continued hypoxemic respiratory failure.  He was advanced to
pressure support with stable ventilation and oxygenation. On
transfer to the CCU patient was still intubated but off
pressors. Patient was extubated successfully.  He was
reintubated [**2201-3-1**] transiently for 48 hours for urgent TEE and
subsequently extubated without adverse effect or complication.

History of Present Illness:

On the cardiology service his abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting
was felt to be secondary to congestive hepatopathy, his cough
due to CHF vs asthma, and his syncope was felt to be secondary
to a coughing spell leading to increased intra-abdominal
pressures and therefore reduced preload in the setting of
low-output state. His ICD interrogation was negative for any
events. He was aggressively diuresed with a net 10 liters
negative since admission. He underwent RHC for milrinone trial,
which proved to be successful. His mean PCW went from 30 to 22,
and his Fick C.I. went from 1.72 to 2.79.

Brief Hospital Course:
48M with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%, on coumadin
&amp; s/p ICD placement), HTN, CKD (baseline Cr 1.3-1.6) &amp; asthma
who presents with syncope, found to be in acute-on-chronic heart
failure.

#) ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE
Underlying exacerbation of chronic heart failure [**2-1**] known
idiopathic cardiomyopathy likely explanation for numerous
presenting symptoms including syncope, abdominal pain, and
dyspnea. Last echo [**8-/2119**] showed LVEF = 25%. He was admitted in
the setting of low output heart failure, leading to increased
intra-abdominal pressures causing congestive
hepatopathy/abdominal pain/RUQ tenderness. Abdominal distension
also thought to contribute to syncope. Cardiac output and wedge
pressure significantly improved after milrinone infusion. In the
ICU he was maintained on milrinone at a rate of 0.5 mcg/hr and
transferred to the floor on this stable dose. Torsemide 80mg
daily was restarted; he was discharged on milrinone and
torsemide. Heart failure specialists had honest discussions with
the patient about his long-term prognosis; he will continue to
be followed closely in heart failure clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] and will
continue work-up for potential heart transplant at [**Hospital1 3278**]/[**Hospital1 336**].

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital with worsening heart failure.

You had a cardiac catheterization that showed you would benefit
from milrinone. You were started on a milrinone drip, with
improvement in your heart's pump function. You were also
diuresed for 6 liters of fluid.

Brief Hospital Course:

# Bipolar d/o, PTSD, schizophrenia:  Psychiatry consult
recommended that all psych medications be held until they could
be re-prescribed by pt's outpatient psychiatrist.  During
hospital course, thorazine was restarted but discontinued soon
after because pt became tachycardic; pt remained asymptomatic
during these episodes of tachycardia. Tachycardia resolved with
discontinuation of thorazine, IV hydration, and small dose of IV
benzodiazepene x 1. Social work consult was obtained because pt
did not have a PCP nor did he have a psychiatrist.  He could not
see his former psychiatrist due to insurance reasons.  With the
help of social work, pt was set up with a PCP who would be able
to refer him to a new psychiatrist in a timely fashion.  He was
instructed to follow-up with his new psychiatrist to restart his
psychiatric medications.

# Chest pain: Pt complained of chest pain during hospital course
that appeared musculoskeletal as it was reproducible with
palpation and pt reported more pain with movement.  EKG showed
no ischemic changes and troponins were flat x 4.  CK was
elevated, peaking at 1405 but downtrended without any
intervention.  TTE was obtained due to history of cocaine use to
rule out cardiac events.  EF was &gt;55%; TTE was unremarkable.  He
was monitored on telemetry without significant events.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at the hospital.  You were
admitted with confusion that was likely due to a combination of
the medications you were taking and the street drugs that you
may have also been used.  Your heart rhythm was monitored
because many of these drugs can affect your heart.  Your EKG and
blood tests showed that you likely did not have a heart attack.
An ultrasound of your heart was also normal.  Your confusion
cleared during your hospital stay.  You were seen by our
psychiatry team who recommended holding all of your medications
while you were in the hospital. It is very important that you
follow-up with a primary care doctor who can refer you to a
psychiatrist.  This psychiatrist can then prescribe to you the
medications you were normally taking.

My dad has been killed recently by doctors treating him in icu for bacterial and fungal pneumonia. First my dad was admitted into ICU in August after seeing his lungs xray and he was put in ICU for 5 days then shifted to room then in 10 days he was discharged. After coming home we thought he was recovering well but on September 30 again he felt severe shortness in breath so when took to the Hispital, doctor said that the lung infection came again and this time its both bacterial and fungal and so my dad was directly admitted into ICU with ventilators support. The ICU patient dies on october 13 and the reason the doctor said is Sudden Cardiac Arrest and it can happen anytime. Other health complications of my dad are diabetes, hypertension, and AML. My question is if the Dr fail to diagonise the lung infection in time? I felt the culture test for presense of bacterial/fungal infection was done late and reports came very late.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 47367**] is a 58-year-old man with a history of AML s/p
allogeneic transplant [**2142**] complicated by graft-versus-host
disease, multiple vertebral fractures and ultimately development
of paraplegia in the setting of a vertebral fracture during a
code situation. Admitted multiple times, most recently [**8-/2148**]
for bacteremia and upper resp infection (cx: staph epi) and
completed a course of vancomcyin, aztreonam. Discharged from
rehab and home (wheelchair bound) with recent clinic followup
[**9-26**] noting baseline health.

Pertinent Results:

BLOOD/FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):
      [**Female First Name (un) **] (TORULOPSIS) GLABRATA.

Brief Hospital Course:

# Goals of care: After frequent discussions with family and
physicians involved in the pt's case and gradual reduction in
number of interventions performed, it was decided to transition
to comfort measures only on [**10-12**]. The below medical treaments,
lab draws, and imaging procedures were held. The pt was kept in
IV morphine, tylenol, and ativan to keep comfortable. He died
peacefully on the morning of [**2148-10-13**].

# Pneumonia: Productive cough followed by somnolence in the
setting of starting Ambien and Valium in addition to his home
oxycontin. CXR with LLL consolidation. Sputum gram stain with
GPCs in clusters, GPCs in pairs and chains and GNRs and yeast.
Started on vanco, [**Last Name (un) 2830**] (day 1: [**9-30**]), mica (day 1: [**10-3**]) in
consultation with ID. Due to worsening CXR, vanco was changed to
linezolid (day 1: [**10-6**]) per ID recs. Also question of possible
pulmonary congestion, so pt was started on IV lasix. On [**10-8**],
the pt appeared to have worsening WBC and respiratory distress.
He was started on ambisome and given a dose of tobramycin. The
tobramycin was thereafter uptitrated with little effect.
Antibiotics were continued despite little improvement.

# Tachycardia: Continues to be in sinus tachycardia in the 130s.
Initially in the 160s, but has improved with fluids. Likely
multifactorial with PE, pain, hypovolemia, and withdrawal from
opioids all contributing. He was given several doses of narcan
at OSH and his home narcotics were initially held in the setting
of hypotension. Morphine drip was started to relieve any pain
without any improvement in tachycardia.

My mother n law had a surgery about 10 years ago, replacing all veins from top of leg to foot. Although that surgery has done well the doctors have had her on blood thinner ever since. Just recently she has gone to hospital due to a fall and they found a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the brain. They took her off the blood thinner, kept in icu for 3 weeks. We asked what would happen now to the original vein surgery (since stopping Coumadin). Are there any specific instructions about stopping Coumadin?

Brief Hospital Course:

Neuro: Patient was followed by neurosurgery through out her
stay. Due to the extent of hemorrhage, a CTA was obtained to
determine if an aneurysm was present, but none were visualized.
Her neurologic status gradually improved and she was weaned from
sedation. Her GCS was 15, though intermittently agitated. Repeat
Head CTA showed expected evolution of the SAH with no evidence
of vasospasm or mass effect or midline shift. She also had
unstable fractures of T10 and T11 confirmed by MRI. She was
taken to the OR and underwent posterior fusion on [**2194-4-1**]
without event.  Additionally, she had a C4 transverse process
fracture with possible ligamentous injury; she had a [**Location (un) 2848**]-J
collar which was to be remain in place until follow-up or
re-evaluation by Spine surgery, which will be in 6 weeks after
discharge on [**2194-4-21**].  She was also evaluated by neurosurgery for
her SAH with recommendations to continue Keppra until at least
follow-up. She did not demonstrate seizure activity during her
hospitalization.

Heme: Received one unit of blood each on [**4-17**] and [**4-11**].
This was not due to concern for acute bleed but rather due to a
slow drift downward.  She had an IVC filter placed on [**4-16**] as
well. She has a history of DVT on coumadin, which was
discontinued after filter placement. Her hematocrit remained
stable between 22-23 for several days prior to discharge and did
not require additional transfusions beyond [**2194-4-11**]. The patient
has a PICC line in place with good placement confirmed on CXR.

Discharge Instructions:

You were on  Coumadin (Warfarin) before your injury, but you
now have a filter in place to help prevent clots from returning
to your heart. You will not have to continue your coumadin at
this point.

Due to prolonged bedrest and the risk of developing a blood
clot, you received an 'IVC filter' to prevent clots from
returning to your heart.

Followup Instructions:

For your subarachnoid hemorrhage:
??????Please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 88**] to schedule an appointment with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **], to be seen in four weeks.
??????You will need a CT scan of the brain without contrast prior to
your appointment. This can be scheduled when you call to make
your office visit appointment.
??????We recommend you see Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in the Traumatic Brain Injury
(TBI) clinic the phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6335**]. If you have any
problems booking this appointment please ask for [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16367**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16368**].

I developed jaundice and had liver failure.I was also placed on life support(I have no recollection and also inubated.This occurred in 2104 and I have never felt physically or emotionally healthly since this occurrance. I had no idea of how long I was in ICU,and when I did awaken several days later,I had no recall of anything. Shortly after I return home ,and weighting less,I noticed I was and still mispell words or write words backwards. Physically,I never gained weight,Inow weight a bit more.I also developed severe depression and exteme anxiety .I was informed that every vital organ was failing.My main question if I had posion in my bloodstream does it remain in my system? And I am very concerned about my writing capabilities. I would appreciate any advice.

Brief Hospital Course:

# Hyperbilirubinemia, ascites, edema, liver failure: The patient
had known risk factors for EtOH hepatitis, and her previous
elevation in LFTs was in the context of admitted EtOH use.
However, given the lack of previous history, other causes were
investigated.  Infectious hepatitis and AIH labs were negative.
She was treated with albumin. EGD revealed 4 cords of Grade 2
varices.  Started nadolol [**1-7**], but d/c [**1-8**] for
bronchoconstriction.  Propranolol was then started on [**1-19**].  Her
MELD score reduced to 16.  Diruesis was started to reduce
ascites and peripheral edema.  Dobhoff feeding tube placed [**1-21**]
for tube feeding given poor nutritional status.  This came out
on [**1-23**] and was replaced after the patient could not maintain
caloric intake.  Tube feeds continued at goal at the time of
discharge.

# Kidney injury:  Cr elevated at 2.2 on admission, last value
0.8 in [**2099**].  Renal ultrasound no evidence of obstruction or
hydronephrosis.  Repeat urine lytes showed that she was
pre-renal with UNa &lt; 10, FeNa 0.08%.  HRS was considered and
treatment with albumin, octreotide and midodrine was initiated.
A course of 5 days treatment did not improve renal function and
these treatments were therefore discontinued.  Creatinine
improved at the time of discharge to a stable value of ~1

# Respiratory distress and MICU course:  On the night of [**1-9**],
the patient spiked a temperature to 101 and developed a new
oxygen requirement.  She was started on vanc/zosyn for hospital
acquired pneumonia but continued to be tachypnic.  In the early
morning of [**1-10**], patient became acutely hypoxic with crackles
throughout her lung fields.  A CXR was consistent with flash
pulmonary edema.  She was treated with IV diuresis and was
transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress.
Echocardiography was consistent with volume overload, but there
was no clear precipitant for flash pulmonary edema.  The patient
recovered rapidly with diuresis and was transferred back to the
floor on [**1-11**].  The cardiology team was consulted and
recommended outpatient follow-up to ensure resolution of right
ventricular distension with appropriate diuresis.

# Mania:  Patient had visual hallucination [**1-12**] overnight.
[**Date range (1) 25386**] she became more manic, was not sleeping, and exhibited
pressured speech and disorganized thoughts.  Psychiatry
consultation was obtained.  She was diagnosed with a mania NOS
and was treated with Haldol.  Other medications were not started
in the context of liver failure.  She was initially subject to
Section 12 for 3 days, however this was discontinued as her
mental status normalized with treatment.  This will need
outpatient follow-up. She needs intensive outpatient
psychotherapy (potentially dual diagnosis facility) upon leaving
LTAC.

Transitional Issues:

- Per Psychiatry:  In outpatient setting, could consider the
following non-urgent
recommendations.  1) Neuropsychological testing to determine
whether or not there may be longterm cognitive deficits
associated with ETOH abuse 2) consider cross-tapering Haldol to
another medication with more mood-stabilizing properties (e.g.
quetiapine)
- Assess when able to change psychiatric meds based on LFTs

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**].  You came to the hospital after being found to
have jaundice.  You were found to have liver disease, causing
jaundice, and kidney disease, causing fluid buildup throughout
your body.  This was treated with hydration and medications that
reduce toxin buildup.  Tests were performed to understand the
extent of your disease.  You were determined to have cirrhosis
(long term damage of your liver), likely due to alcohol intake.
You were treated with diuretics to reduce the fluid overload in
your body.

An endoscopy revealed a duodenal ulcer that was thought to be
the cause of some slow GI bleeding.  The ulcer was cauterized
(burned) and you were treated with omeprazole.

You had an episode of respiratory distress that led to a brief
stay in our intensive care unit.  You were there overnight and
responded well to medical treatment.  You then returned to the
floor.

You were found to have some aspects of mania during your stay.
Our Psychiatry team worked with you and suggested treatment with
Haldol.  They also suggested a stay in a psychiatric facility to
help you gain control of this disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the obstetrics and
gynecology service for an emergent CSection in the setting of
fetal distress and discordant growth. Her procedure was
complicated by massive blood loss of 1.7 liters
intraoperatively. She did not require a hysterectomy for control
of her bleeding, but was found to have elevated LFTs (AST250
ALT291 AP350 TBili 10.6 and INR 3.6) as well as rising
creatinine. She was resuscitated with multiple blood product (2
pRBC, 2 FFP, 4L NS) and was taken to the ICU intubated for
further recovery with a tentative diagnosis of fatty liver of
pregnancy. During this time she continued to be coagulopathic
with worsening LFTs, and large transfusion requirements. The
Acute Care Surgery Service was consulted, at which point she was
noted to have an extremely distended abdomen with bladder
pressures greater than 50 mmHg. Her Cr had improved from her
intraoperative values, but she continued to have a rising
lactate (5.4), evidence of end organ dysfunction (hypotension)
and rising peak inspiratory pressures. A diagnosis of abdominal
compartment syndrome was made and the patient taken to the
operating room for an emergent decompressive laparotomy. She was
found to have multiple bleeding sources including a left
epigastric artgery, and diffuse surface bleeding from the liver
without evidence of laceration. Due to ongoing bleeding and the
patient's coagulopathy the patient was left with an open abdomen
with a plan for washout following aggressive resuscitation. She
was diagnosed with fulminant hepatic failure and transferred to
the transplant surgery team for further management. Because the
patient remained intubated and sedated, and no neurological
assessment could be made, a CT Head was obtained that
demonstrated significant cerebral edema but no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage, herniation or ischemia. Neurosurgery
was consulted and a bolt placed and management per the standard
bolt protocol. On [**2-24**] (POD#2) the patient was taken to the OR
for abdominal washout, but continued to have significant bowel
wall edema that prevented abdominal closure. She also required
CVVH due to acute kidney injury, which was initiation on POD 0.
She was managed with the fulminant hepatic failure guidelines
and was listed for liver transplantation, with all of her
relevant serologies negative. On [**2-25**], the patient continued to
demonstrate no significant neurological function and an MRI was
obtained without evidence of acute injury. She continued to be
hypotensive and required D10 to maintain a normal blood glucose.
Endocrinology was consulted for concern of sheehans syndrome or
centrally mediated adrenal insufficiency, and cortisol levels
were obtained, and were low. The patient was given a steroid
burst with hydrocortisone and weaned to maintainence levels over
the next several days. On [**2-27**] (POD5) the patient was taken to
the operating room for an uneventful abdominal closure, and this
was performed without difficulty.

Hi There, my best friend who is 36 yrs old have a severe asthma attack, quick led to a heart attack and stopped breathing for 13 min before being resuscitated. After being in ICU for 6 days, doctors removed his breathing apparatus and he has been able to breathe independently since.

Brief Hospital Course:

# PEA arrest and subsequent anoxic brain injury.: Suspect that
original OSH PEA arrest due to hypoxemia or acidosis, with [**Hospital1 18**]
ED PEA arrest due to acidosis with admission pH 7.16 on arrival.
 TTE with evidence of RV failure to suggest PE. LVEF 30% with
known dilated cardiomyopathy. He was cooled per protocol.
Initially, his EEG was concerning without evident brain
activity. On hospital day 3, there was only comatose activity
and his prognosis was guarded. However, the patient was able to
be weaned off the vent and over the course of the next three
days his mental status improved.  He was alert, oriented to
place and day of the week and moving all 4 extremities.  He
became more interactive on transfer to the floor, was initially
speaking in spanish and English and not always making sense but
then started responding more appropiately and following
commands.  On hospital day 11 he had a witnessed grand mal
seizure and was given ativan and started on Keppra with
neurology consult.  His mental status was worse for 24 hours
after the seizure but then he slowly returned to his recent
baseline.  He was somewhat aggitated so his Keppra was switched
to Topiramate. He had a subsequent seizure on [**3-18**] with LUE
tonic clonic activity and impaired consciousness but this
resolved spontaneously after 1-2 minutes. He was contineud on
topamax per neuro recommendations. OT and PT were consulted and
worked with the patient as he will likely require a long
rehabilitation course.  At the time of discharge the patient was
alert, oriented (though not always to date), following commands
but impulsive with poor motor planning leading to several falls.
 Neurology notes indicate the patient has the potential
toimprove from a neurologic standpoint. He also may have
recurrent seizures which should be treated with ativan IV or IM
and do not neccessarily indicate patient needs to return to
hospital unless they continue for greater than 5 minutes or he
has multiple recurrent seizures or complications such as
aspiration.
-patient will be on Topiramate 25mg PO BID until [**3-22**] PM then
increase to 50mg po BID for seven days then increase to 75mg [**Hospital1 **]
ongoing.
-patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in his s/p
arrest neurology clinic
-patient will require intensive PT and OT in an anoxic brain
injury unit.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Anoxic Brain Injury s/p PEA arrest x2
Status Asthmaticus
Ventilator Associated Pneumonia
Chronic Systolic Heart Failure
L1 compression fracture
Seizures after hypoxic brain injury


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker
or cane) because he has poor motor planning


Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital after having a cardiac arrest and an
asthma exacerbation.  You had another cardiac arrest in our
hospital and were admitted to the MICU.  You required intubation
but were able to wean off the machine and breathe on your own.

A friend went to the emergency room this past Monday morning with severe flu-like symptoms. On Thursday, she was diagnosed with meningitis. On Friday afternoon, it was determined to be viral, and she was rereleased with instructions to stay home and rest for 1 week. Yesterday she was beginning to feel better, but is not feeling as well today as yesterday. Is this fall back today a normal part of the recovery process, or Is it a sign of a possible relapse? Should she perhaps be gotten back to the hospitals? Thanks for your time.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the general neurology service. MRI of the T 
and L spine were obtained which showed stable degenerative disc 
disease without spinal cord compromise. On the morning following 
admission the patient was eager to leave the hospital. We 
explained that we would like her to be evaluated by physical 
therapy before discharge. She was informed that leaving the 
hospital may result in permanent paralysis. She expressed 
understanding of this risk and left the hospital against medical 
advice.

Discharge Instructions:

You were seen in the hospital for leg numbness and weakness.  We 
did an MRI of your middle and lower back but did not do one of 
your neck.  We wanted you to stay in the hospital for this and a 
physical therapy evaluation, but you decided to leave against 
medical advice.  We explained to you that this would put you at 
risk for permanent paralysis if you did not stay for an 
evaluation but you decided to leave despite understanding this 
risk.

We did not change any of your medications.

Hi. I came to the hospital with testicle pain and swelling and got antibiotics for a penis skin infection. My pain went away but now my testicles have become very weird hanging and it seems like they shrunk in size. I went to the ER and they told me it was all normal. I tried masturbating and when I ejaculated the sperm was very watery and there is no white just clear like water. Very little sticky. What’s really going on here? I’m afraid it might have spread to my prostate and seminal vesicles too... Does this mean I’m infertile?

Brief Hospital Course:

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Chronic Abdominal pain with flare of nausea/vomiting:
Patient with several year history of episodic severe epigastric 
abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting with prior gastrointestinal 
evaluation unrevealing. The patient has had an abnormal gastric 
emptying study in the past, but most recently on ___ her 
gastric emptying was normal. Prior abdominal imaging with 
pancreatic divisum but no evidence of chronic pancreatitis. She 
complained of two distinct types of back pain, upper back pain 
thought possibly related to abdominal pain but unclear. Saw 
outpatient gastroenterologist on the day of presentation, who 
scheduled EUS to rule out pancreatic cause. Consulted advanced 
endoscopy team, and they felt that pancreas divisum would not be 
a likely cause of her pain. She had an unremarkable CT A/P with 
contrast and EUS which was unrevealing for a cause of abdominal 
pain, but did note fatty pancreas. Results discussed with 
outpatient GI provider, who felt her abdominal pain at this 
point may be referred or radiating from the spine and 
recommended outpatient pain consult and followup as scheduled. 
She initially required IV dilaudid and PO oxycodone for pain 
control, and says she takes oxycodone rarely at home for pain 
flares. Received IV -&gt; PO antiemetics. She had no episodes of 
emesis. Pain and nausea improved and she was able to tolerate PO 
by discharge. She was started on IV Famotidine, which was 
transitioned to PO and continued on discharge, though she had no 
evidence of esophagitis/gastritis on EUS so this can probably be 
quickly discontinued if no apparent benefit. Ultimately still 
unclear why she is having such severe abdominal pain.

# Chronic Mid back pain:
She noted crampy bilateral mid-back pain which seemed to flare 
both with and without abdominal pain. Patient reports massaging 
her back for hours at home with some improvement. This pain 
seemed more consistent with muscle spasm and did not seem 
necessarily related to her abdominal pain. Trialed increased 
frequency of home flexeril with unclear benefit so resumed home 
dosing on discharge. Trialed lidocaine patch. If this is MSK 
type pain, weight loss may help, this was discussed with 
patient.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# ADD: Held Adderall, resumed on discharge

# Anxiety: Held clonazepam, resumed on house

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
[] reevalute need for famotidine at followup and stop if not 
helping
[] rx short course of oxycodone for continued pain control
[] started standing acetaminophen for pain, if continuing longer 
than a few weeks, please monitor LFTs and renal function
[] recommended outpatient pain consult and integrative medicine 
consult at ___, both discussed with patient and she is 
agreeable
[] referral for outpatient ___ provided
[] could consider starting gabapentin if not already trialed

Discharge Instructions:

You also had a lot of back pain. You had pictures taken of your 
back. You should see a physical therapist as an outpatient. You 
should also go to the pain clinic.

You can take the oxycodone for a short time and follow up with 
Dr. ___.

I spent yesterday in the ER with thumping heart beats i.e. palpitations. I had all blood work, a full panel, enzymes etc., EKG, chest x-ray, and TSH because I’ve had a total thyroidectomy. In October of last year, I had a walking stress test and all the same tests then, all of which are normal, showing no sign of any cardiac issues. My palpitations are benign, I’m told. Fine, how can I slow them or stop them without some antiarrhythmic meds? Of course, even though I’ve been told I’m fine, I feel them and sometimes worry which triggers the stress bug, then my chest gets tight, I have to take deep breaths to get out from under the stress. Is there anything I can do to relieve them? They really started when I started taking levothyroxine.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thyroidectomy to remove multinodular goiter, performed by ___ on 
___

Brief Hospital Course:

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure, multifactorial
# Multi-Nodular Goiter
# Obstructive sleep apnea, severe

The patient has had severe obstructive sleep apnea diagnosed in 
___ for which he has been on various forms of PAP. He has 
a history of non-compliance with his CPAP. The patient lives in 
a group home due to his schizophrenia, where he was found 
almost completely unresponsive and was therefore brought to OSH 
where initial ABG resulted as 7.28/68. A CT scan revealed a 
large multi nodular thyroid with compression on the trachea, 
and the patient was transferred to ___ on ___ for further 
evaluation. The patient's hypercarbia at ___ was thought to be 
multifactorial: at baseline, he has longstanding severe OSA 
with CPAP non-compliance; his new multinodular goiter, which is 
compressing the trachea, is likely causing upper airway 
obstruction that is exacerbating the pt's hypoventilation. ENT, 
endocrinology, and sleep medicine consultants evaluated the 
goiter and recommended surgical removal given concern for 
obstruction due to tracheal compression as well as the 
potential for malignancy. An ultrasound was performed which 
confirmed multi-nodular anatomy of goiter with tracheal 
compression; no biopsy was taken as there was already planning 
to remove the thyroid. Importantly, all teams expressed to the 
patient that it would be unsafe to discharge the patient prior 
to surgery, as the patient would be at high risk to return from 
his group home with hypercarbic respiratory failure again, 
which has happened multiple times. After several family 
meetings, the patient and his mother (legal guardian) were in 
agreement that surgery would be indicated. On ___, the 
patient underwent thyroidectomy performed by ENT. Post-op he 
was transferred to the SICU, where he remained stable. He was 
subsequently transferred to the medical floor.

# Subclinical Hyperthyroidism. TSH found to be 0.1 with normal 
T3/T4, free T4. This problem became irrelevant after the 
surgery, and endocrinology would like close follow up in the 
outpatient setting to manage hypothyroidism s/p thyroidectomy. 
He was started on levothyroxine.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to Emergency Department on ___. Pt 
was evaluated by trauma team upon arrival to ED. Given findings, 
the patient was admitted for observation and advanced 
evaluation. There were no adverse events during his stay. 

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was managed with oral medication. He was 
evaluated by neurology, who formulated the following A/P:
___ right-handed male with Crohn's Disease on Prednisone
and Humera who was transferred from ___ for further
evaluation of a pulmonary contusion after a restrained MVC.  The
exact sequence of events leading up to the car accident are
difficult to verify given the pt's retrograde amnesia and that
the pt's grandmother was sleeping in the car until she heard a
loud "bang" just prior to the car leaving the road and crashing
into the tree.  The pt is currently asymptomatic save some neck
tension suggestive of a neck strain possibly secondary to whip
lash, but he does not have any scalp hematoma nor any focal
features on exam.  His attention, memory and cognitive exam are
normal and does not have any asymmetries on exam.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. 

GI/GU/FEN: The patient tolerated well a regular diet, he did not 
suffer abdominal pain, nausea or vomit during this admission. 
Patient's intake and output were closely monitored

Occupational therapy evaluated the patient, he passed TBI 
screen, no concerns from OT standpoint, no services needed. OT 
agrees with discharge when medically cleared. 

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
 
* Take deep breaths as often as possible. This will help expand 
the small airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up 
secretions that sometimes pool in the lungs. 

 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.

I have a history of panic attacks. two weeks ago I went to ER for a bladder infection.  The doctor asked if I had irregular heartbeats or a-fib, which lead me getting very panicky. He decided to do an ekg, and it was normal, but after that day i keep thinking on it. now keep feeling rapid heartbeats and palpitations plus lot of chest discomfort. IT SCARES THE DAYLIGHTS of me. can all this be overthinking about what happened that day or can something be wrong with my heart ?

Discharge Instructions:

Why was I admitted to the hospital?
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having chest 
pain. We wanted to rule out a ___ cause.

What happened while I was here?
- We did a very thorough work up to make sure your heart isn't 
the cause of your chest pain. This included EKGs, blood tests 
that look at whether the heart is under stress, and a CAT scan 
to make sure you didn't have a tear in any major blood vessels 
or a blood clot in your lungs. These were all normal. You did a 
stress test and another special heart study called a MIBI, which 
did not show any heart problems. 
- We gave you Ativan and Tylenol, which improved your pain.
- We also started you on a medicine called sertraline which 
helps with anxiety, which might be the cause of your chest pain.
- We checked your thyroid function which was normal.
- We checked your cholesterol which was normal. 

What should I do when I get home?
- Continue taking all your normal medications and the new 
sertraline and Ativan to help with your chest pain. 
- You should see your primary care doctor this week. He/she will 
discuss any additional tests you may need and help manage your 
new medications. 
- While taking Ativan, you should not drive or operate heavy 
machinery since this can be very dangerous.

Last week my 61 yr old sister woke up with a terrible headache and was not able to walk because she felt the room was spinning. She went to Intermountain Medical Center in Salt lake City, Utah and was admitted. After many tests, she was told she was having a migraine headache and was sent home with a prescription for sumatriptan. The headache has gotten better, but she is still very dizzy. So what is the dizziness from I never heard of a migraine that can cause your head to spin like that.

Discharge Instructions:
You were evaluated in the Neurology Wards of the ___ 
___ for headaches that were of an unusual 
quality. We conducted a series of tests to investigate the cause 
of your headaches, including a CT scan and an MRI, a series of 
laboratory tests as well as a lumbar puncture. Through these 
tests, we were able to rule out serious intracranial causes that 
can cause a headache, including pseudotumor cerebri, which is a 
condition where elevated intracranial pressure can cause 
headaches and subsequent visual damage. We also checked an MRV 
(MR venogram) which ruled out cerebral venous thrombosis (a 
blood clot in the veins of your brain). 
- We started you on a new medication called verapamil. Take this 
once daily even if you do not have headaches (everyday, by 
mouth). 
- Inform your PCP of this change, and please follow up with your 
primary care appointment and neurology appointment. 
- You can request your PCP to set up a referral to see a 
neurologist in the community if you would prefer to do so. 
- To achieve optimal control of your migraines, avoid 
caffeinated products and keep a relatively regular sleep wake 
cycle (go to bed early, wake up early).
