My partner has end stage liver disease (alcoholic cirrhosis). Hepatic encephalopathy seems advanced. He is home, but because of his confusion and disorientation, he cant be left alone. He has been in and out of the hospital/ICU several times. His doctor told him he was dying, and when the doctor and I were alone he said it could be days, weeks, or months, but not likely a year. I feel lost and not sure what to expect. Financial and health POA are all set. What information in his records will be useful to determine how long does he have?

History of Present Illness:
47M with decompensated alcoholic and HCV cirrhosis, with history
of hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, esophageal varices s/p
banding and Budd-Chiari syndrome treated conservatively without
anticoagulation, several recent admissions (last [**Date range (1) 29493**]),
who presents now with altered mental status, hyponatremia, and
[**Last Name (un) **].

Brief Hospital Course:
A 47 year old male with PMH ETOH/HCV Cirrhosis complicated by
hepatic encepthlopathy, varices, portal gastropathy, and ascites
is admitted with toxic metabolic encephalopathy and acute renal
failure.

# Goals of care: Patient admitted with progressive liver failure
and hepatic encephalopathy refractory to traditional treatment.
He then developed anuric renal failure and hepato-renal
syndrome. Given that he was not a candidate for transplant and
had exceeded the limits of medical therapy, a family meeting was
held with his mother and HCP [**Name (NI) **] and goals of care were
transitioned to comfort.

#Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: related to hepatic
encephalopathy, infectious work up was remarkable for positive
U/A. He was treated with lactulose via NGT which was limited by
vomiting, he did not have many bowel movements initially and
goals of care were then transitioned to comfort measures and NGT
was discontinued.

# Renal failure: patient admitted with creatinine at 3.1 above
baseline 1.5 Urine Na:&lt;10 consistend tiwht hepatorenal syndrome
(HRS). He was treated for preseumed HRS with albumin, octreotide
and mitodrine. GFR continued to decline and he became anuric.
Goals of care were transitioned to comfort.

#Alcoholic/HCV Cirrhosis: complicated by hepatic encepthlopathy,
varaces, portal gastropathy, and ascites. Not listed since he
has yet to start ETOH abstinance program. Hepatology was
consulted and did not think he was a candidate for transplant.

#Hyponatremia: Hypervoemic hyponatremia related to cirrhosis.
Baseline sodium has been between 115-120.  Patient admitted with
Na 119, acute encephalopathy was thought to be unrelated to
hyponatremia. He was placed on fluid restriction and sodium
trended up to 131.

# Hyperkalemia: Initial labs showed elevated potassium (7.1) in
the setting of hemolyzed labs, on re-check potassium is 6.0 and
likely related to acute renal failure.  After Keyexylate, K
trended down to 4.0.

# Possible cellulitis: Exam remarkable for ill defined
erythematous patches on the calves bilaterally. He was treated
with cephalexin which was changed to ceftriaxone to cover
urinary tract infection. Antibiotics were discontinued when
goals of care were changed to comfort.

# Pyuria: U/A on admission was negative however repeat u/a
following foley placement showed positive leuks and bactereia.
He was started on ceftriaxone given acute encephalopathy as UTI
could have contributed to confusion. Ceftriaxone was d/c when
goals of care were changed to comfort.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2154-1-20**] for
emergent repair of his ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic
aneurysm. He was taken immediately to the operating room where
he underwent an emergent salvage repair of ruptured
thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with a 34-mm Dacron tube graft
using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Please see operative
note for details which included cardiac arrest x2.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring with an open chest. He remained intubated and sedated
on pressors and inotropes. On [**2154-1-22**], he returned to the
operating room where he underwent exploration and chest closure.
On [**1-25**] he returned to the OR for abd closure JP/ drain
placement/ feeding jejunostomy placed at that time for
nutritional support.

Wounds: thoracoabdominal wound healing well with exception of
very small open area mid wound that is @1cm around and 1/2cm
deep, no surrounding erythema. Packed with dry gauze and covered

Discharge Instructions:

At first, you were in the ICU, but when you improved, you were
transferred to the regular neurology floor for care.

After someone hits their head, we watch them very closely for
signs of worsened swelling or bleeding in the brain. All of your
scans after the fall were relatively stable, and you made great
progress with your level of alertness, memory, and physical
activity in the days following the accident.

On [**2174-2-11**], it was noted that you were not holding your oxygen
levels as high as we would like so a chest x-ray was done, and
indicated that you were developing a pneumonia. We started IV
antibiotics for this right away, and you improved.

Physical and occupational therapy saw you during this hospital
stay, and recommended a short stay in rehab before you return to
your home. At rehab, you will work to become stronger and safer
on your own.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17881**],
You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and
low oxygen levels that were believed to be due to an
exacerbation of your chronic congestive heart failure. You were
temporarily admitted to the intensive care unit, so that you
could receive supplemental oxygen through a positive-pressure
mask. You were given medications to help removed excess fluid
from your body, and your symptoms subsequently improved. Our
orthopedic surgeons believed that you do not need to wear the
collar for your cervical vertebral fracture. Your pacemaker was
interrogated and found to be working appropriately. Through your
course here, you were seen to have delirium on top of chronic
dementia.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],
You were brought to the hospital because of behavior changes at
home. You became very agitated at the outside hospital and you
required multiple medications for sedation and eventually needed
to be intubated. Your intubation was complicated by a pneumonia
and you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of your
pneumonia and your mental status changes.

You were treated with a 7 day course of antibiotics for your
pneumonia and you improved. You were seen by psychiatry and
neurology. You again became very agitated and required IV
sedation to control your agitation.

You then improved without additional medications.

        <note_excerpt>
History of Present Illness:

Pt was initially admitted to the OSH [**Date range (1) 29693**] for two
episodes of epigastric pain and abnormal LFTs (AST 466 ALT 268).
US and MRCP were reportedly normal. She was discharged with
diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis. That evening, pt called her GI
doctor complaining of severe abdominal pain, n/v, tremulousness.
She presented to the ED and was re-admitted. She was noted to be
jaundiced, groggy, with a protuberant abdomen. WBC was 13.8, K
2.8, Bili 7.7, AST 324, ALT 370, alk phos 251, lipast 4877. Tox
screen and EtOH levels were negative. Her abdomen became
distended, tense, very tender, with no bowel sounds. She was
transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring. She was treated
with IVF and aggressive pain control with dilaudid 1mg IV q3.
Additionally she was sedated on precedex and an ativan drip at
4mg/h. Pt was intubated for airway protection on the morning of
[**10-14**]. CT of the abdomen revealed enlarged indistinct pancreas,
extensive peripancreatic fluid consistent with severe
pancreatitis and pancreatic necrosis, no loculated or drainable
fluid collections or evidence of perforation. Also noted were
small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate amount of free
fluid in the deep pelvis.

How is the patient expected to control the pain after being treated for pancreatitis?

        <note_excerpt>
Brief Hospital Course:

# Pancreatitis: Possibly due to gallstones seen on CT and
abdominal ultrasound. Patient's lipase was not elevated at the
OSH but had radiological findings and abdominal pain. The
patient's abdominal pain gradually resolved, initially as NPO
with IVF/TPN and then advanced a regular diet.  Pt will need
ongoing monitoring of nutrition intake given her low albumin.

FOLLOW-UP:
-Please make sure patient sees a gastroenterologist within 2
weeks after discharge for management of pancreatitis/pancreatic
hemorrhage. We have arranged for follow-up for a
gastroenenterologist at [**Hospital1 18**] but feel free to cancel this
appointment and make arrangements with a different
gastroenterologist.
- Patient will need MRCP to look for signs of liver malignancy
or infiltrative disease.
- She should be reevaluated for G-tube placement in [**4-10**] weeks.
- She should have repeat Contrast CT of the abdomen to evaluate
for residual pancreatic pseudoaneurysm

Discharge Instructions:

The following changes were made to your medications:
ADDED:
- STARTED Daptomycin 350 mg iv every 24 hours until [**2109-6-11**] for
14 day course
- STARTED Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth daily
- Remeron (mirtazapine) 7.5 mg by mouth at night
 CHANGED:
- INCREASED frequency of vicodin from twice a day to every 6
hours as needed for pain
REMOVED:
- STOPPED Omeprazole (added pantprazole instead)
- STOPPED Morphine liquid suspension (increased frequency of
Vicodin)
- STOPPED Gemfibrozil
- STOPPED Valium
- STOPPED Benadryl

Brief Hospital Course:

# RUE DVT: Otherwise, her anticoagulation for her upper
extremity DVT was continued (lovenox) with coumadin being held
given plan by IP to exchange out the tracheostomy tube in early
[**Month (only) 116**].  After IP decided that they were going to hold off on this
procedure, Lovenox was discontinued and the patient was
restarted on coumadin with daily INRs being checked.

Discharge Instructions:

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were hospitalized
at [**Hospital1 18**].  You were admitted to the hospital because your
primary care doctor thought that you were retaining a lot of
fluid.  While you were in the emergency room, your pressures
were low and you were initially admitted to the intensive care
unit.

While on the medicine floor, your blood pressures remained in a
good range.  Your oxygenation levels were varying, and you
required a return to the intensive care unit for one night. You
have been doing better since then.

It will be VERY important that your oxygen levels stay in the
range of 88-92%.

Brief Hospital Course:

1) Urinary Tract Infection/Concern for Urosepsis: The final
culture results from the outside hosptial suggested that the
patient had urinary tract infection caused by E coli. sensitive
to all agents tested except E. coli. Despite the presumptive
positive blood cultures final results would suggest the patient
did not have a true bacteremia.  All cultures taken at our
institution were negative for growth at the time of discharge.
At [**Hospital1 18**] the patient initially received a dose of vancomycin
then was continued on pipercillin-tazobactam from [**Date range (1) 70177**]
when final culture and sensitivity results from the urinary
pathogen were obtained from the outside hospital and showed
sensitivity to quinolones.  Thus, patient was transitioned to
oral ciprofloxacin therapy.  She remained afebrile on this
regimen and was discharged on day five of appropriate therapy to
complete a nine additional days of antibiotic therapy for a
total course of 14 days  Regarding management of her neobladder
the patient had a foley placed on presentation.  Once
perforation was essential ruled out by the CT cystogram urology
approved her to return to her home schedule of clean
intermittent cathterization and she was discharged to continue
this.

Followup Instructions:
You should schedule a follow-up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 365**] in urology in [**12-30**]
weeks to discuss further management of your urology issues.

You need to schedule a follow up with your PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 9449**], in
[**12-30**]  weeks to discuss this admission.  The most important issues
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9449**] needs to check on are to make sure your liver
enzymes are improving (she should have the values from this
hospitalization by that time)and to schedule an abdominal
ultrasound to see if the abdominal fluid has resolved (this
would probably best be obtained around the end of [**Month (only) 404**], four
weeks after your discharge).  Dr.[**Name (NI) 70178**] office can be
reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 70179**].

My mother whom is 53 and very very health consicous had a extreme onset of confusion Tuesday. She started having confusion, speech was highly impaired and it was very difficult for her to get accross anything. Again this was sudden. She would type on facebook and text and everything was a mess. She thought she needed to go to the eye doctor because she d been having eye heatlh problems which she has to receive shots for. She hasn t had a eye injection in three weeks now. When she arrived there she did not have an appointment they called an ambulance because she wasn t making any sense! She knew something was wrong and drove to the eye doctor with her hazards lights on. She arrived at the hospital ER and they immediately performed a cat scan and MRI which showed no signs of definite stroke . She arrived at hospital at 2:00 in afternoon. While in ER with her she did not know her name or any of childrens name! She didn t understand anything! She was so confused and complained of headache. She never slurred speach, she just was making sense. At 1:00 A.M. she still didn t know her name or her children s name. At 6:00 A.m. Wednesday she regained the ability to express her name and she knew who her children were. She remember s alot of what happend. Which I find amazing!! Like I said she excersises and eats right all the time!! So the doctor s have been all over the place on what happened! Neorolgist first suspected minnie stroke but now they all say different things. One said she had a urinary tract infection , one doctor said she did not, one doctor put her on blood thinner and one doctor took her off. Now they are saying that her potasium, magnesium and sodium were too low and this is what has caused all of this. She just got out of the hospital. I am confused because they seem to be!! My mother even pulled down her paints in the ER and used the bathroom on the floor. She would never do that!! So she was confused for 18 hours total not knowing who she was or who we were. Can you help with what may have happened with her?

My mother whom is 69 and very very health consicous had a extreme onset of confusion Tuesday. She started having an eye pain, then confusion, speech was highly impaired and it was very difficult for her to get accross anything, severe headache. She would type on facebook and text and everything was a mess. She thought she needed to go to the eye doctor because she d been having eye heatlh problems which she has to receive shots for. She hasn t had a eye injection in three weeks now. When she arrived there she did not have an appointment they called an ambulance because she wasn t making any sense! She knew something was wrong and drove to the eye doctor with her hazards lights on. She arrived at the hospital ER and they immediately performed a cat scan and MRI which showed no signs of stroke . She arrived at hospital at 2:00 in afternoon. While in ER with her she did not know her name or any of childrens name! She didn t understand anything! She was so confused and complained of headache. She never slurred speach, she just was making sense. At 11:30 Tuesday night they put her in ICU. At 1:00 A.M. she still didn t know her name or her children s name. At 6:00 A.m. Wednesday she regained the ability to express her name and she knew who her children were. She remember s alot of what happend. Which I find amazing!! My mother lost 100 pounds by eating everything right and excercising all the time. She has never swayed from her goal of being fit for the rest of her life since two years ago. Like I said she excersises and eats right all the time!! So the doctor s have been all over the place on what happened! Neorolgist first suspected minnie stroke but now they all say different things. One said she had a urinary tract infection , one doctor said she did not, one doctor put her on blood thinner and one doctor took her off. Now they are saying that her potasium, magnesium and sodium were too low and this is what has caused all of this. She just got out of the hospital. I am confused because they seem to be!! My mother even pulled down her paints in the ER and used the bathroom on the floor. She would never do that!! So she was confused for 18 hours total not knowing who she was or who we were. It all started with the eye pain.... Can you help with what may have happened with her?

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with confusion, low magnesium,
potassium, and calcium. In the ED, you had a seizure that was
most likely due to your low electrolytes and also alcohol
withdrawal. Your low electrolytes were attributed to your
chronic diarrhea, alcohol use, and poor nutrition. A CT scan of
your head did not show any acute problems. Our neurology
colleagues saw you and recommended correction of your
electrolytes and abstinence from alcohol. You were seen by PT,
OT and social work who are concerned about your ability to care
for yourself at home.  You are being discharged to a rehab
facility to help you regain your strength and ensure a safe
return home.

The following changes were made in your medications:
START Magnesium Oxide 400 mg twice daily with breakfast and
dinner
START Amlodipine 5 mg by mouth daily
START Folic Acid 1 mg daily
START Thiamine 100 mg daily
START Vitamin D 50,000 units weekly (on Saturdays) for 6 weeks

DISCONTINUE
Magnesium Chloride

You may changed the Magnesium Oxide to Magnesium Chloride if you
continue to have difficulties tolerating the medication.

Discharge Instructions:
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight &gt; 3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet

You were admitted to the hospital because your sodium,
potassium, magnesium, and phosphorous levels were very low. You
were given fluids and electrolyte repletion to which you
responded quite well.  Your diuretics (lasix and HCTZ) were
stopped and you were started on another diuretic name
spironolactone which should not affect your electrolytes as
much.  In addition, it is likely that you were quite dehydrated
and may have an abnormal level of the hormone aldosterone.  The
level of this hormone was sent but results have not returned.
You should follow up on this with your primary care doctor who
will receive the results.

In addtion, you were found to have a urinary tract infection
with E.coli that was sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Treatment was
started in the hospital but you should complete a total 7 day
course of antibiotics which will last three and a half days
after discharge.  You should not take cipro at the same time as
any vitamins (iron, calcium) as these medications may bind to
the cipro and cause it to be less effective. You may take the
medications at seperate times throughout the day.

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
with a complaint of abdominal pain. CT scan, abdominal
ultrasound, MRI, and EGD did not show a clear cause for your
pain, but ruled out conditions that would require emergent
intervention. Your pain improved over the course of your stay.

While you were here, you were noted to have a very low
hematocrit (red blood cell level). There was no evidence that
you were actively bleeding. You received 3 units of packed RBCs
to raise your hematocrit to a safer level.

In addition, you were noted to have significant swelling in your
legs, groin and abdomen. This swelling is due to excess fluid
that accumulates because of your liver disease. We have made
changes to your diuretic regimen that we hope will help to
decrease swelling.

We have made the following changes to your medication regimen:
- INCREASE DOSE of lactulose as needed to ensure [**2-26**] bowel
movements daily (OK to take as often as every 1-2 hours)
- BEGIN TAKING Lasix (furosemide) 40 mg by mouth twice daily
- BEGIN TAKING Aldactone (spironolactone) 50 mg by mouth daily
- TAKE AS NEEDED Ultram (tramadol) 50 mg every 8 hours as needed
for pain
- TAKE AS NEEDED Tylenol (acetominophen) 500 mg every 6 hours as
needed for pain

Please keep your follow up appointment as directed below.

Followup Instructions:
# ULTRASOUND Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 327**] Date/Time:[**2161-1-16**] 9:00
# Liver: [**Name6 (MD) 1382**] [**Name8 (MD) 1383**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**]
Date/Time:[**2161-1-16**] 10:40

You will need to have your electrolytes checked at this visit
(by blood draw). Assuming that your electrolytes remain balanced
and your kidney function is stable, your doctor may wish to
increase your diuretics to further help reduce your swelling.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after presenting with
abdominal pain and being found to have a blood clot in the
portal vein of your liver and small bowel. You were unable to be
anticoagulated for this clot because you developed a bleed in
your bowel. You were followed closely by the Surgery and
Hepatology service. You were treated with blood transfusions for
your bleed. Your hematocrit stabilized and you required no
further blood transfusions. You are completing a 14 day course
of antibiotics to treat the inflammation in your GI tract caused
by the blood clot.

You were found to have a pleural effusion caused by your liver
disease. You underwent a thoracentesis to treat this fluid
accumulation. You are continuing on diuretics, lasix and
spironolactone to help prevent a reoccurrence of this effusion.

During your hospitalization you also developed an irregular and
fast heart rate called atrial fibrillation. You were treated
with a medication called diltiazem to slow your heart rate. You
are being discharged on telemetry for further monitoring of your
heart rate and adjustment of your medications.

Your diuretics spironolactone and lasix were briefly held. You
have been restarted on lasix 10mg daily and spironolactone 50mg
daily. Your urine output and weight will continued to be
monitored and adjusted as needed.

You will need to follow up with Hepatology as scheduled below.
You are being discharged to a acute rehabilitation facility for
continued physical therapy and medication adjustment.

What is the expcted course of her recovery from bronchitis?
        </clinician_question>
        <note_excerpt>
Brief Hospital Course:
___ F h/o COPD p/w worsening SOB x 3 wks, now with cough 
productive of green sputum and CTA indicating bronchitis and 
small airway infection. Ms. ___ was seen in ED and had 
CTA chest negative for PE as well as negative troponins in the 
setting of chest heaviness. She was admitted due to persistent 
SOB and treated with PO prednisone for a COPD exacerbation. She 
was also started on a five-day course of azithromycin for 
bronchitis/small airway infection.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES

Sputum was collected in efforts to test for MAC via AFB smear 
and culture, but the sample was not processed as expected.  
Sputum cytology was negative for malignant cells (although the 
yield is low).  On CTA chest, there was an opacity in the 
periphery of the right middle lobe which was not specifically 
commented upon in the radiology report.  Repeat CT chest imaging 
in ___ weeks is advised.  If lungs have not cleared in the 
interim, further evaluation for MAC pulmonary infection ("Lady 
___ syndrome") and malignancy is advised.  Patient was 
scheduled for outpatient follow-up with Pulmonary Medicine.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
* Pt will be discharged with home ___ services. Please do oxygen 
saturation monitoring as an outpatient and refer to pulmonary 
rehab as appropriate.
* Pt should follow-up with Pulmonary Medicine as an outpatient. 
Please repeat chest CT in ___ weeks as an outpatient to assess 
interval change.  If lung findings have not cleared in the 
interim, further evaluation for MAC pulmonary infection ("Lady 
___ syndrome") and malignancy is advised (see below).
* Sputum was collected to test for AFB smear/culture, but the 
specimen did not get processed as expected. If repeat chest CT 
is abnormal, consider testing sputum for AFB smear and culture 
to assess for MAC pulmonary infection ("___ 
syndrome").
* Given history of smoking and COPD, family history of lung 
cancer, and finding of peripheral opacity in right lung on CTA, 
sputum cytology was tested and returned negative for malignant 
cells. Please note that sputum cytology has a low yield for 
abnormal cells, and further work-up would be necessary to 
definitively rule out malignancy if repeat chest CT remains 
abnormal after pulmonary/small airway infection clears.
* Also of note, pt is on a variety of psychiatric medications at 
home, including bupropion, quetiapine, venlafaxine, and 
topiramate. This combination of medications increases risk of 
serotonin syndrome. Optimization/simplification of psychiatric 
medication regimen as an outpatient is encouraged.
* Please consider whether estradiol and progesterone remain 
necessary and, if so, determine their expected duration.  
Discontinue when possible so as to avoid risk for blood clot and 
other complications.

Discharge Instructions:

Please see the attached medication list for changes to your home 
medication regimen.  You will have short courses of azithromycin 
and prednisone to finish at home.  Other medications include eye 
drops and nystatin mouth solution.  Also, you have a 
prescription for a nicotine patch.  We strongly encourage you to 
continue avoiding cigarettes, as you have done while 
hospitalized.  Smoking cessation is an important step toward 
improving your health. 

Please follow up with Pulmonary Medicine according to the 
appointment list below.  You should have a repeat chest CT scan 
in ___ weeks.

Yes, I just returned from the hospital! The doctors did a great job! My main Complaint was Severe Chest pains on my left side, Radiating from my Sternum up and around my upper portion of my left chest, close to my collar bone, then down the left side of my body! Stopping at the bottom portion of the left side of my chest! They drew Blood samples, did an EKG, ran X-Rays And said I was not having a Heart attack! Which I Trust and Believe is True! Even after all the Pain Medication they gave me in the hospital, I had no relief from the Severe pain! I am not worried about the pain, as much, as to what this Ailment might be? I also have Numbness from my Elbow down to my finger tips! I have not had any recent Injuries! No Severe Coughing fits? I have quit smoking about a month ago? I have no Dizziness, nor am I lightheaded! Just the Severe Pain on the left side of my chest, with numbness from my left elbow down to my finger tips! Any Suggestions, of what it could be?

Hi I have recently read that chest pain can be a symptom of a thoracic bulging disk, but also have seen other medics say this does not cause chest pain so which is it? I had 2 emergency spinal surgeries in l2 &amp; l4 area and have a disc that feels like it’s popping between my shoulder blades regularly and I recently get more and more chest pain even while lying down. I have a diagnosis of fibromyalgia and I am very fatigued all the time. Chest X-ray and ECG normal today as are blood work.

Discharge Instructions:

___ were admitted to ___ with sudden-onset left flank pain in 
the setting of being treated for bronchitis.  ___ had a chest 
x-ray and rib x-ray while ___ were admitted, which did not show 
any pneumonia or rib fractures.  ___ also had a V/Q scan (an 
imaging test to evaluate for conditions such as blood clots in 
the lungs), which was indeterminate.  However, ___ were deemed 
to be at very low risk for blood clot.  Your flank pain is most 
likely due to inflammation of the tissues near your lungs and 
ribs from your bronchitis.  ___ will need to continue taking 
steroids to treat your bronchitis for 3 more days.

Please continue taking all other medications as prescribed by 
your outpatient providers.  The following changes were made to 
your medications:
- Re-started prednisone 20mg for 3 more days

Hi, I have been experiencing some dizziness the last couple of days...not spinning, just feeling unstable on the feet, sometimes I feel like I step onto an uneven ground and kind of wobble a little...occasionally, I also feel sudden tingling/numb in the lower back of the head...the dizziness can last for hours but mostly when I am standing up and walking around...I was at the emergency room twice with some signs of heart attack (chest pain) but tests came back normal except with some test that indicated a potential insufficient blood to the heart...(very mild case and may not been conclusive according to my cardiologist). I am otherwise very healthy with a little of thyroid issue and no family history of heart issue...I have continued with my exercise routine (cardio and strength training) and have not created any problems....Could I possibly had a mini stroke that they did not get picked up on?? I will need to travel (fly) for work and I am a little concern....thanks

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the ___ Neurology Service on ___ for 
further workup of your episode of imbalance, blurry vision, and 
neck discomfort. A CT of your head did not show any acute bleed 
or infarct, but did show acute-on-chronic sinusitis. An MRI of 
your head did not show any evidence of a bleed or infarct 
either.

As part of your workup a chest x-ray and EKG were completed. The 
chest x-ray did not show any acute process with your lungs or 
heart. The EKG shows a left bundle branch block in your heart, 
which may represent a previous myocardial infarction.

Your labwork included cardiac enzymes (to evaluate for 
myocardial ischemia) which were negative. Your ammonia level was 
normal (high levels can cause brain dysfunction). Your 
cholesterol was 189, triglycerides 95, HDL (good cholesterol) 
55, LDL (bad cholesterol) 115, and hemoglobin A1c (measure of 
blood sugar over time) 5.9%. A lamictal level was sent off, but 
not available at the time of discharge. You will be notified if 
this level was abnormal.

The left bundle branch block seen on EKG is new from a previous 
EKG in ___. To further evaluate this new finding, a 
transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was completed. The results of 
this study showed hyperdynamic left ventricle with moderate 
resting outflow obstruction, mild to moderate mitral 
regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension. This result is not 
immediately concerning and no intervention is necessary at this 
time. Please stay well hydrated to avoid any symptoms that may 
surface such as lightheadedness or dizziness. You will also 
followup with a cardiologist.

The symptoms you were experiencing yesterday may be related to 
medication use or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Your 
labwork and imaging studies are not suggestive of a stroke or 
other acute neurological issue. 

You were started on aspirin 325mg daily and also simvastatin 
20mg daily. The simvastatin was started to lower your 
cholesterol (goal &lt;100). You should continue all of your home 
medications in addition to the new prescriptions.

On your flight to ___, you should get up to walk and stretch 
several times. Also remember to take your aspirin.

You have a followup appointment with Dr. ___, as 
seen below. You also have a followup appointment scheduled with 
Dr. ___, Cardiologist, as seen below. You should also 
followup with your primary care physician within the next couple 
of weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo man w/ past medical history of lung cancer s/p 
pneumonectomy, MI, CVA, who presented w/ possible syncope 
leading to MVC. Family requesting transfer to ___ 
where he receives his care, we facilitated this prior to 
completing our own workup. Of note on transfer, intial imaging 
did not show any acute intracranial process, c-spine fractures, 
or signficant intra-thoracoabdominal injury. He was noted on 
final read of CT torso this morning to have L1 compression 
fracture of vertebral body, likely old per radiology, but he did 
endorse low back pain on admission.

# Low back pain: As described above, CT imaging showed L1 
vertebral body compression fracture, likely old. Pt also 
endorsing back pain near L1, although his pain is somewhat 
lateral to the right along the paraspinous muscles as opposed to 
midline at the spinous process. He does not have any new neuro 
deficits, or trouble moving his bladder or bowels decreasing 
suspicion for cord impingement. This will need to be evaluated 
further on transfer.

Discharge Instructions:

You were brought to ___ after an automobile collision during 
___ you might have lost consciousness. You were evaluated for 
possible injuries, of which several were found:
1. Bruise R ear
2. Laceration to your finger
3. Possible L1 vertebral compression fracture, although this may 
be an old injury based on the CT scan interpretation by our 
radiologits.

The remainder of your radiology imaging did not show any 
fractures, although there were several irregularities w/ your 
kidneys and your aorta that we suggest you have evaluated. These 
have been detailed in your transfer documentation, and you 
should ask your physicians at ___ what kind of 
follow up evaluation and care you will need. 

We also evaluated you for the loss of consciousness. Although 
our work-up was not complete at your time of transfer, we did 
determine that your heart rhythm on ECG was slower than normal, 
and that you had several premature atrial contractions. We 
evaluated a blood lab called troponin that shows possible heart 
ischemia, this was negative.

You requested a transfer to ___ where you receive 
your care. The doctors at ___ agreed to this 
transfer, and you are being sent there to finish your 
in-hospital evaluation for syncope and any injuries you might 
have from the car accident.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital after you presented in liver
clinic with evidence of worsening belly fluid, chest pain, and
low blood counts.

While here at the hospital you were evaluated with blood work
and imaging. You were found to have low blood counts, so a
series of labs and imaging was done to see if there was any
evidence of bleeding. You were also tested for a variety of
conditions that might be involved with breaking down blood
cells. These tests returned negative, suggesting that your low
blood counts were consistent with the your ongoing liver
disease. You were given blood transfusions to treat your low
blood counts, and the transfusions went well when you were
premedicated with a medication called Tylenol and Lyrica.

We would like you to follow-up with Dr. ___ to look at your
blood counts. There may be consideration of a further study
called a capsule study should you continue to have blood count
drops. You may also need to receive iron infusions outside the
hospital.

You also had symptoms of chest pain when you were admitted. You
were tested for heart attack with electrocardiogram,
echocardiography, and lab work. The tests were negative. There
was however some concern regarding some of your right sided
heart function, so your ongoing fluid/diuretic management will
be very important. We would like you to follow-up with Dr.
___ restarting your home diuretics and nadolol.

There was also ongoing concern regarding your kidney function,
so your home diuretics were held while you were in the hospital.
We would like you to follow-up with Dr. ___ starting
your home diuretics.

When you go home it will be very important for you to take your
previous medications as prescribed, excepting the furosemide,
spironolactone, and nadolol. You may resume your home diabetic
control.

I recently took a HPT and the result was positive, but other than fatigue I feel like I’ve had no pregnancy symptoms. Also my home life has been very stressful. Last week I was in the ER for a migraine and the doctor wanted to test my urine for pregnancy and protein. The doctor called me back 24 hrs later and asked me to make an appt for prenatal care but did not tell me whether or not the pregnancy test or protein test came back positive or negative. I don t know whether to tell my husband we might be expecting or not and I do not want to get my hopes up either. We really want to have a baby. So, I guess what I’m asking is in a doctor’s opinion do I start getting my hopes up or should I be worried that something is wrong?

negative for vascular injury. She spike a fever to 102.5, blood, 
urine and mini BAL sent (BAL grew 3+ GNRs later found to be 
Moraxella catarrhalis). Her Hct was down to 20.5 and she was 
transfused 1U pRBC, her Hct responded to 25.2. By Hospital day 
2, patient was moving all extremities and following instructions 
and so she was extubated. Patient was able to ventilate well on 
face mask afterwards. On Hospital Day 3, patient passed her 
speech/swallow evaluation and so the NGT was removed. Psychiatry 
was consulted for passive SI and depression, recommended 
starting Citalopram 40 mg QD. Her Foley was removed and she 
voided. On Hospital Day 4 the patient was transferred to the 
floor where she continued to work w/ physical therapy, which 
recommended rehab. 

On the floor, she continued tolerate a normal diet, was voiding 
independently but required pain control titration. She was 
started on Bactrim for a 7 day course for her M. catarrhalis CAP 
and initiated on Macrobid for a UTI as defined by a UA. 

By day of discharge, her pain was well controlled, she was 
eating, voiding, and eliminating independently, and her cough 
was controlled with inhalers and antibiotics.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital after being involved in a 
MVC. You sustained fractures to your cervical and thoracic 
spine, in addition to a rib fracture and a right clavicle 
fracture. You were fitted for a special brace for stabilization 
of your neck and spine.  You also sustained a laceration to your 
scalp which was staples. You had an airway placed to assist with 
your breathing and you were monitored in the intensive care 
unit. Because of your injuries, you were evaluated by the Spine 
and orthopedic services. You were evaluated by physical therapy 
and recommendations made for discharge to a rehabilitation 
center to further improve your mobililty. You are being 
discharged with the following instructions:    

** Rib Fracture
* Your injury caused a right 1st rib fracture which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
* Do NOT smoke
* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are very effective in 
controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil, Aleve, 
Naprosyn). 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

- Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the 
Emergency Department for any of the following:
* You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or 
tightness.
* New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
* If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your 
medications.
* You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, 
diarrhea, or other reasons. Signs of dehydration include dry 
mouth, rapid heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
* You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have a 
bowel movement.
* You experience burning when you urinate, have blood in your 
urine, or experience a discharge.
* Your pain in not improving within ___ hours or is not gone 
within 24 hours. Call or return immediately if your pain is 
getting worse or changes location or moving to your chest or 
back.
* You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees 
Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
* Any change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern 
you.

My husband has symptons of lighted headedness and slightly dizzy. A week ago he was in the emergency room because he was weak and couldn t walk, got nauseated and broke out in a sweat. (Taken by ambulance to emergency room.) Stayed overnight in the hospital. They did a CT scan of head to determine if he had a stroke and that came back negative not even a mini stroke. Also had chest exray, EKG, Echocardiogram and lots of blood tests. All came back negative and he still is not 100 per cent. Was tested for Lymes Disease and that also was negative. He had a stress test this past Tuesday and everything was OK. Now this weekend he had another spell of lightheadedness and felt a little dizzy. Any answers as what to do next.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with history of migraines, 2 prior 
hemorrhagic strokes and severe bilateral carotid stenosis who 
presents with complaints of acute onset of dizziness.

1. Dizziness.  Given Ms. ___ significant vascular history, 
she was admitted for MRI to rule out a posterior circulation 
stroke.  MRI showed no sign of stroke, and MRA showed preserved 
posterior circulation.  She does have known severe internal 
carotid disease, but nothing that can be intervened on at this 
point.  She was evaluated by physical therapy, who found her 
gait to be improved, and that she was safe for discharge home.  
It was suspected that her symptoms were related to a combination 
of her peripheral neuropathy, her autonomic instability, and her 
prior migraines, as she did develop a headache following this 
event.  She will continue to follow-up in the ___ clinic.  
Exam on discharge was notable for mild gait instability, and 
bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for dizziness.  You had an MRI which showed no 
sign of a new stroke.  It is likely that your symptoms were 
secondary to a migraine.  You should continue to take your 
current medications.

If you notice new weakness, sensory loss, worsening dizziness, 
or other concerning symptoms, please return to the nearest ED 
for further evaluation.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted after a small amount of hemoptysis (coughing 
up blood). A CAT scan of your chest showed bleeding in your 
lung. The interventional radiology team did a procedure to get a 
clear look at the blood vessels in the area and to try to put a 
clot in the blood vessel to prevent further bleeding. They were 
not able to reach the right spot without risking making your 
condition worse, but they were able to tell that it would be 
safe for the interventional pulmonology team to do a 
bronchoscopy (look down your windpipe at your lungs from the 
inside with a camera) and cauterize the area to lower the chance 
of future bleeding. You underwent both procedures without any 
difficulty and did not have any further bleeding during your 
admission.

You also received an MRI of your L shoulder to see what the lump 
might be - it is a benign (not cancerous) lump of fat. The bone 
is normal. There is nothing that needs to be done about it 
today. Please discuss with your primary care doctor if you 
continue to have pain in the area.

Please notify your oncologist or PCP about the development of 
ANY new symptoms, most specifically, any increased weakness in 
the legs, falls, trouble urinating or not urinating, trouble 
having bowel movements or not having bowel control.

        </clinician_question>
        <note_excerpt>
Brief Hospital Course:

This is a 73 year old man with a history of aortic stenosis,
afib on coumadin, s/p "significant" MI ([**2132-11-28**]), recent left
arm/leg weakness c/w CVA admitted on [**2133-1-11**] with dyspnea and
suspected CHF exacerbation.

# Dyspnea: The patient's initial shortness of breath was felt to
be multifactorial.  He presented with expiratory wheeze
concerning for COPD exacerbation. Chest CT prior to admission
was notable for possible interstitial lung disease. He recieved
1 dose of Vanc/Zosyn in the ED, but this was discontinued as
there was no evidence of PNA on chest xray.   The patient was
initially admitted to the MICU for and treatement with
azithromycin and prednisone where initiated. In addition, he was
treated with a lasix drip for possible CHF exacerbation.  Over
the course of his hospitalization, the patient's dyspnea
improved significantly and he was transferred to the cardiology
service early in his hospital course.  While improved, his
baseline dyspnea continued to be an issue and this was felt to
be due to his underlying heart disease.  He was continued on
albuterol and ipratroprium for COPD and his heart function was
further evaluated (see below).

# Chronic Right Heart Failure: The patient had a history of
rhemumatic valvular disease.  His BNP was markedly elevated on
admission, up to 8462 from 3822 on [**12-19**].  He was initially
treated with a lasix drip with good response, however he
continued to have shortness of breath.  Initial troponins were
0.02, but they did not continue to rise. It was felt he would
benefit from cardiac catheterization to assess his valvular
disease.  On cath, the patient's Cardiac index was determined to
be 1.4.  There was evidence of severe mitral stenosis,
regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, as well as moderate
aortic stenosis. TEE was suggestive of the same.  At that time,
it was felt that best treatment would be surgical. CT surgery
was consulted and the patient was felt to be a good surgical
candidate; he was transferred to surgery (see below).

# Acute on Chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine on
arrival was 1.5; however his previously documented baseline from
[**2132-1-11**] was 1.1.  There was some initial concern that this
was an acute exacerbation his his reanl failure, but over the
course of his hospitalization, this did not improve.  It was
felt that his decreased renal function was possibly secondary to
poor forward flow/cardiac output. His new baseling this
hospitalization appeared to settle between 1.3-1.5.  His
lisinopril was held, but he was continued on standing lasix for
fluid balance management in the setting of his heart failure.

# OSA: The patient was noted to have episodes of desaturation
while sleeping and to have daytime somnolence.  Empiric
treatment with CPAP was started with impressive improvements in
the patient's sleep.  We recommend that the patient follow up
with his pulmonologist to determine if he would benefit from an
outpatiet sleep study and arrangement of home CPAP.

# Cardiothoracic Surgical Course:He was taken to the operating
room on [**2133-2-3**] and underwent an aortic valve replacement and
mitral valve replacement, both tissue valves.  This procedure
was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Mr. [**Known lastname 8336**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] the procedure
well and was transferred in critical but stable condition to the
surgical intensive care unit.  He was extubated and his chest
tubes were removed.  His pressors were weaned and he was started
on an ACE-inhibitor.  A thoracentesis was performed and 650 mL
of serosanguinous fluid was removed.  His epicardial wires were
removed and he was started on coumadin for his atrial
fibrillation.  By post-operative day four he was tranferred to
the surgical step down floor.  He was seen in consultation by
the physical therapy service.  On post-operative day seven he
was started on Keflex

Brief Hospital Course:

# Torsades de pointes/Cardiac arrest: Pt was transferred to CCU
on [**2125-2-6**] for management of torsades de pointes. She was given
4mg Mg IV and started on standing Mg repletion. Disopyramide was
discontinued since she was felt to have long QT and torsades
secondary to disopyramide. She was noted to have increasing
ectopy on telemetry [**2125-2-6**] in pm and again went into VT with
loss of consciousness and pulse. Code blue was called. She
received external shocks x 2 and was intubated for airway
protection. She received epi and atropine and lidocaine bolus.
She was started on isoproterenol and subsequently levophed for
hypotension. Femoral line placed under sterile conditions during
code. After this episode, she had occasional runs of NSVT but no
further sustained VT. On [**2125-2-8**], she was weaned off levophed
and groin line was d/c'd.  Around noon, she developed SVT with
HRs 160s trending down to 120s which appeared to be afib.
Isoproterenol was discontinued. She was started on metoprolol
12.5 [**Hospital1 **] which was uptitrated as tolerated then changed to
diltiazem with improved heart rate control. She was subsequently
extubated. She had residual chest wall pain after CPR and rib
films revealed non displaced rib fractures. Pain was was
controlled on tylenol.

# Mild volume overload: Initially patient had left-sided failure
with evidence of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions on
imaging and minimal basilar crackles on exam, likely secondary
to the atrial fibrillation. No evidence of right-sided failure.
No history of CHF. On TTE had severe valvular disease (see
below) that was most likely the cause of her CHF. Diuretics were
held in light of acute kidney injury and after patient converted
to NSR symptoms of CHF resolved.

# Severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]: On TTE done to work up a murmur on exam and
atrial fibrillation patient had severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Cardiac
surgery was consulted and felt a MVR and TVR were required. The
patient underwent some pre-op studies including a cath that
showed clean coronaries. She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] in
2 weeks to schedule her surgery.

# [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward
secondary to afib with RVR. Initially losartan and
triamterene/HCTZ were held. Creatinine trended down. Patient was
given lasix for diuresis given evidence of CHF on exam as above.
With lasix had creatinine bump so further diuresis was held,
however, patient converted to sinus rhythm and had self-diuresis
thereafter with lessening of her CHF symptoms. She was restarted
on losartan at 25mg daily (home dose 100mg daily) before
discharge.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital with difficulty breathing and
an abnormal heart rhythm. You were started on medications to
control your heart rate. Unfortunately, a side affect of one of
your medications caused a complicated rhythm that required CPR
and intubation.  Luckily, you recovered from both but did have
some rib fractures as a result of the CPR.

While you were here you had an ultrasound of your heart that
showed a leaky valve. The cardiologists and cardiac surgeons
think they you will need this repaired. In preparation for your
valve repair you had a cardiac catheterization. This showed no
blockages in your coronary arteries. You had a breast biopsy as
well and the final results were still pending at the time of
discharge. Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] for the final
results.

In brief, his hospital course proceeded as follows:

The patient received three units of PRBCs at the outside
hospital and banding of his esophageal varices. On transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**], he has two EGDs which showed 2 cords of grade II varices
in the lower third of the esophagus. 2 cords of grade I varices
were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.  The stomach
mucosa showed erythema, friability and congestion of the mucosa
with contact bleeding noted in the stomach body, fundus and
antrum.  The findings were compatible with severe portal
gastropathy.  The patient was seen and evaluated by the liver
and transplant teams and scheduled for a TIPS procedure,
However, during his early hospital course, his hematocrit
dropped from 28.2 on admission to 25.0, likely from slow GI
bleeding.  At this point he was transfused two units of PRBCs.
Following transfusion, his hematocrit remained stable in the low
30s.  He continued to pass guaiac positive stools during his
hospital course. He was monitored on telemetry and remained
hemodynamically stable throughout his hosptial course.  He was
started on FeSO4 for iron deficiency anemia.  His vitamin B12
and folate levels were normal.

(2) Colonic thickening on CT: Abdominal CT showed minimal
colonic wall thickening likely due to portal hypertension rather
than colitis.  However, on physical exam the patient did have
some RUQ and RLQ abdominal pain.  He also had consistently
positive guaiac positive, dark/tarry stools.  The ob+ stools
were attributed to his portal hypertensive gastropathy and
thought to be due to old blood, as his hct remained stable.  C.
diff was sent given that he had been on levofloxacin, but was
negative times 2.  He is recommended to receive a colonoscopy as
an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:

1. Please take all medications as prescribed.
2. Please keep all follow-up appointments.
3. Please seek medical attention if you develop fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stools, lightheadedness, chest
pain, shortness of breath or have any other concerning symptoms.

You will need to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the
Liver Center within 10 days after discharge.

You will need to continue Levoflox for a total of 7 days (4 more
days left). Continue your ferrous sulfate and use laxatives for
regular bowel movements.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 84-year-old female with multiple
medical problems admitted with increased fatigue and found to
have a hematocrit of 19 down from her baseline 30 with
guaiac-positive stool and negative nasogastric lavage at an
outside hospital.  She was initially admitted to the MICU,
and subsequently transferred to the floor.

1. Gastrointestinal bleed:  Initially, there was a question
of whether or not this patient had a GI bleed with a guaiac
positive stool at an outside hospital, but no history of
frank melena or hematemesis, and her most recent stool guaiac
negative.  The patient was transfused again when she got to
the floor, two more units to have her hematocrit above 30
with her history of coronary artery disease, the next day it
was noted that her hematocrit had dropped from 32 to 25, and
that she did pass a large melanotic stool.

At this time, she again was transfused above 30 and did
maintain at this level throughout the rest of her
hospitalization.  She had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy done
at that time which did not show any active bleeding from her
stomach or proximal duodenum.  It did show duodenal
diverticulosis.

The patient did have a past history of a Dieulafoy's lesion
in the past as seen by her outside hospital medical records,
this was not seen during her esophagogastroduodenoscopy
during this visit.  It was thought that most likely her bleed
was from a diverticulum in the setting of patient having a
high INR.

Her INR on transfer to the floor from the MICU was 3.2 after
having her Coumadin held.  Coumadin was held for the next few
days with no drop in her INR.  In-fact, it increased to 3.9
over the next three days.  This was thought secondary to poor
nutritional status.  In the setting of her hematocrit dropped
and melanotic stools seen on the floor, her anticoagulation
was reversed with vitamin K and 2 units of fresh-frozen
plasma.  Her hematocrit remained stable for the remainder of
the hospitalization after reversal of her anticoagulation.

Brief Hospital Course:

Mr. [**Known lastname 64239**] was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**] [**Name (NI) **] surgical
service on [**2126-5-20**] for hypotension and anemia from persistent
stomal variceal bleeding. With hypotension, he was admitted to
the surgical intensive care unit. Plan for TIPS procedure [**5-20**]
to divert portal blood flow to systemic circulation in order to
minimize bleeding. Repeat procedure on [**5-22**] due to concerns of
portal flow. Shunts were extended and findings of occlusion of
proximal portion. Required neo for vasopressor support but was
extubated immediately afterwards. Patient tolerated a regular
diet and then transferred to surgical floor on [**2126-5-25**] with
stable blood pressures. Displayed worsening encephalopathy on
[**2126-5-27**] with increasing abdominal distention. Diagnostic
paracentesis with cytologies consistent with SBP. Moreover, on
[**2126-5-28**], patient developed hematemesis. [**Hospital 64293**] transferred to
the SICU. He was intubated and upper endoscopies performed by
GI, showed no active bleed but duodenal ulcers. After procedure,
hemodynamically unstable and consistent with systemic infectious
physiology. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and CT
scan performed showing increasing abdominal ascites and pleural
effusion. Bedside ultrasound guided drainage of both
collections, sent for culture and cytology. Drains left in place
to decompress both cavities. Cultures returned enterococcus. He
continued antibiotics (meropenem, vancomycin). Daily
surveillance cultures continued and returned positive. All
central and access lines were removed and re-sited. However,
continued to be bacteremic. No clear site identified. TEE did
not show any vegetations, suggesting likely infected TIPS.
Cultures then returned with yeast and vancomycin resistant
enterococcus. His antibiotic regimen was switched to daptomycin.
Cultures again positive with Stenotrophomonas. Regimen switched
to IV Bactrim in addition to meropenem and daptomycin. HD
continued as clinically needed based on clinical exam and
electrolytes, transfused as needed for low Hct, continued on all
immunosuppression medications. On [**2126-6-13**], patient decided to
withdraw care and resort to home hospice for further care. He
was coherent and mentally capable as this decision was made. He
was discharged with palliative care recommendations on [**2126-6-13**].

GI: Patient with history of liver [**Date Range **] x 2 c/b hepatic
artery thrombosis. Anti-coagulation was held due to parastomal
bleeding. TIPS to attempt to divert blood flow. Abdominal fluid
was drained via ultrasound guidance and external drain left in
place. Patient's LFT continued to be abnormal as CT also
suggested areas of necrosis. CT also demonstrated SMA
thrombosis. Heparin was started to begin anticoagulation. As
patient's clinical status worsened, he began to bleed again from
his ostomy. Hct trended and remained fairly stable. Patient was
re-listed for another liver [**Date Range **] but he refused.

ID: With SBP, patient started on meropenem given history of
resistant E.coli. Patient with septic physiology, started on
empiric antibodies of vancomycin and Flagyl. Patient continued
to be bacteremic. Pls see lab section. Daily cultures continued
to be positive and microbe returned with Enterococcus. This
eventually became Vancomycin resistant and switched to
Daptomycin. Additional cultures positive for [**Female First Name (un) **] and
Stenotrophomonas. Central, arterial and HD lines re-sited for
persistent bacteremia. ID consulted for recommendations and
regimen switched to Micafungin, daptomycin, and IV Bactrim. TEE
revealed no cardiac source. Ultimately, discussed with patient
possible need for another liver to remove likely infected TIPS
site. Patient refused after understanding the risks and
benefits. Patient also kept on Prograf immunosuppression. Levels
were checked and dosing adjusted daily.

Brief Hospital Course:

66F with hx of stage [**Doctor First Name **] squamous cell cervical cancer, s/p
combined chemoradiation with nephrostomy tube and recent history
of urosepsis from Klebsiella pan-sensitive and lower GI bleed
related to radiation proctitis who presented with dark stools
and 3 point drop in her Hct, now found to have new pulmonary
metastases and early cardiac tamponade.

# Goals of care discussion - After it was determined that the
patient had signs of cardiac tamponade, family meetings were
held with the patient, her husband, daughters, and palliative
care.  The patient made the decision that she did not want to
undergo chemotherapy again and did not want invasive therapies
such as a pericardiocentesis.  The decision was made to move
towards hospice care and the patient will be discharged to a
hospice house with focus on comfort care.

# Cardiac tamponade - Pericardial effusion noted on CT, then
tamponade confirmed with echocardiography.  Patient was never HD
unstable - this finding prompted goals of care discussion as
above given need of pericardiocentesis and then window if
treatment desired.

# GI bleed - The patient initially presented with dark stool -
she had no hematochezia so GI felt this was less likely related
to her radiation proctitis.  There was an initial plan to
attempt further laser therapy, but this was decided against
after the goals of care discussions.

#. Stage IV cervical cancer - CT on admission showed new
metastatic lesions in the lungs.  The patient stated she would
not want to undergo further chemotherapy.  Palliative Care was
consulted and decision was made for hospice care.

Discharge Instructions:

It was a pleasure getting to meet you and care for you during
your hospitalization.  You came in because of chest heaviness
and dark stools.  Unfortunately, a CAT scan of your chest showed
new metastatic lesions from your cancer - it also showed fluid
around your heart which was confirmed with an Echocardiogram.
After discussion with you and your family, it was decided to
focus on treating your symptoms and alleviating suffering.  To
that end, you will be going to a hospice house where they will
focus on symptom management.  You will have a new medication
regimen that will be provided for you there.

Brief Hospital Course:

65 year-old male with coronary artery disease, atrial
fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type with neuropathy and tobacco
dependance admitted [**2144-3-10**] with productive cough and SOB for 3
days. Patient was initially admitted to MICU, then medicine
service, and finally to cardiology service prior to discharge.
Hospital course was as follows.

1. Hypoxia:  Etiology likely multifactorial. On initial
presentation, patient was with adequate O2 saturation on RA and
became progressively hypoxic with IVF resuscitation and Afib
with [**Month/Day/Year 5509**].  Lobar pneumonia treated with good response with
ceftriaxone (ten day course with 3 days of cefpodoxime
prescribed at discharge) and azithromycin (5 day course).  Pt
became fluid overloaded intermittently with shortness of breath,
which responded well to 20mg IV furosemide.  Pt also experienced
great symptomatic relief with brochodilators suggesting a
brochospasm component to his dyspnea.  After several days of
gentle diuresis, antibiotics and nebulizer treatments, patient
was saturating 95% on room and breathing comfortably.
Discharged on continued antibiotics, furosemide, and albuterol.

3. Atrial fibrillation with [**Date Range 5509**]:  Patient has known atrial
fibrillation and is status-post failed ablation. Suspect current
worsening precipitated by CAP, hypoxia &amp; long standing smoking
history. Patient not anti-coagulated per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] given
history of IVH from multiple falls.  He was treated with
increased doses of metoprolol and continued to enter A-Fib with
[**Last Name (STitle) 5509**] to the 140's.  For a short time his Toprol XL dose was
doubled. On discharge, his heart rate was well-controlled with
diltiazem SR 240mg PO daily and metoprolol succinate 100mg PO
daily.

4. Coronary artery disease:  Patient was without chest pain
during episodes of atrial fibrillation with [**Last Name (STitle) 5509**]. EKGs
essentially unchanged though low voltage in limb leads. He was
continued on aspirin, Plavix, beta-blocker, and statin per his
home regimen.

5. Diabetes mellitus, type II:  Blood sugars poorly controlled,
in the 300-400 despite excellent outpatient control with A1C of
6.6. This was likely due to prednisone treatment in the ED and
the stress of his illness. [**Last Name (un) **] was involved in management and
guided daily insulin regimen changes. Patient's diabetes
mellitus is complicated by neuropathy; he was continued on
gabapentin 300mg PO TID per home regimen.

8. Anemia:  Hematocrit remained at baseline (~30). Normocytic
with labs consistent with iron deficiency. Patient with known
history of [**Last Name (un) 499**] cancer s/p partial colectomy. Continued iron
325mg PO daily, and recommend to patient that he have a repeat
colonoscopy as an outpatient.

10. Pulmonary hypertension:  Moderate based on recent TTE.
Source unclear, but may be related to left heart failure +/-
acute illness. Patient recommended to have pulmonary follow-up
as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital because of difficulties
breathing and a fast heart rate.  You were found to have
pneumonia and extra fluid in your lungs which was making it hard
to breath.  During your hospital stay, you were given
antibiotics for your pneumonia and your heart rate was
controlled by increasing some of your medications. We also gave
you a medication to keep fluid off of your lungs. We also
discovered you had a low blood count due to an iron deficiency.
This may mean you have another problem in your [**Month/Day/Year 499**], and it may
be necessary to have another colonoscopy in the future.  Please
discuss this with your doctor.

If you have any of the following problems or any symptoms that
are concerning to you, please return to the emergency department
or call your physician:
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Difficulty breathing,
- Fever,
- Fast heart rate,
- Confusion,
- Inability to eat, or
- Pain or pressure in your chest.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST; CT ORBITS, SELLA &amp; IAC W/ &amp; W/

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT of the head and temporal bones.

FINDINGS: Again demonstrated is the small subdural hematoma
along the superior sagittal sinus near the vertex which is not
appreciably changed. Suspected subdural hematoma of the inferior
left frontal lobe is not well visualized on today's examination.
No new sites of intracranial hemorrhage are identified. There is
no shift of normally midline structures. The ventricular system
is stable in size and configuration. There is no evidence of
acute major vascular territorial infarction. There is mild
mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinus and moderate right
maxillary sinus mucosal thickening. Opacification of several
bilateral mastoid air cells is noted with small fluid levels in
a few of the air cells. The middle ear cavities are clear. There
is no evidence of temporal bone fracture. No gross abnormality
of the bilateral ossicles or middle ear structures are
identified.

Brief Hospital Course:

Pt was admitted to the hospital to the ICU for observation and
close monitoring after slip and fall resulted in Subarachnoid
hemorrhage and subdural hematoma.  Pt underwent Angiogram which
was negative for aneurysm.  He was started on Nimodipine. Stroke
consult was obtained for intial syncope workup. He was placed on
meclizine for continued complaints of vertigo.  He was
transferred to a regular floor and evaluated by the ENT team for
the c/o vertigo.  They performed Epley Maneuver from which the
pt has relief of symptoms.  They diagnosed him with benign
positional vertigo.  He was seen by PT and deemed safe for
discharge with a home safety eval.  His dilantin and nimodipine
were stopped as he has never had a sz during this stay nor is
his SAH thought to be aneurysmal.  he was d/c'd to home without
pain medication per his request.  Follow up and instructions
were discussed.

Brief Hospital Course:

Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 39 year old male with ETOH abuse who presented on
[**3-18**] with lactic acidosis, profound weakness and found to be
severely thiamine deficient consistent with a diagnosis of Beri
Beri. He had components of both wet and dry: high output heart
failure, edema and severe weakness.  The patient was repleted
aggressively with Thiamine, a multivitamin, and had an NG placed
for nutrition. He developed refeeding syndrome requiring
agressive electrolyte repletion. He developed ETOH withdrawal
and mental status changes approximately 24-48hr after admission.
He was treated with small doses of benzos and mental status
improved somewhat before he was called out to the general
medicine team on [**3-21**]. Initially, the patient was working with
PT/OT and was evaluated by speech &amp; swallow. On [**3-23**], he was
advanced a dysphagia diet and the following day, he spiked a
fever to 101.8. Initial infectious work up revealed negative UA,
neg Blood Cx, negative Cdiff and possible infiltrate on CXR.
Chest CT revealed bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Lumbar puncture showed 2 WBCs, RBC 366, glucose 62 and protein
28. The patient was started on Vanc, Zosyn, and Cipro for
possible HAP/Asp PNA. He triggered on [**2191-3-24**] for tachypnea,
tachycardia, and hypoxia. His hypoxia resolved, and CTA was
subsequently negative for PE. Mental status further deteriorated
after fevers began and there was concern for intermittent
seizures due to bilateral upper extremity tremors and periodic
eye deviation. 2mg Ativan was given without significant
improvement. The patient was loaded with Keppra 1gram, started
on empiric Acyclovir 700mg IV TID and Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **]. The
neurology attending recommended transfer to MICU where he had
continuous EEG monitoring.

Upon return to the medicine floor, the patient continued to have
fluctuating mental status, occasional tachycardia and
temperatures, presumed to be related to repeated aspiration
pneumonitis. All cultures continued to be negative.  The patient
had a dobhoff tube placed for primary nutrition with tube feeds
and eventually was restarted on pureed oral feeding only when
alert and awake. The patient was again transferred to the ICU
for tachycardia and tachypnea that did not resolve with
non-rebreather treatment, and with fevers to 102F.

## Weakness: On initial presentation the patient was
quadraplegic. With thiamine repletion he improved to extremity
strength of [**4-6**]/5 and plateaued at this strength. He was seen by
PT and OT while in house and discharged to [**Hospital 98**] rehab for
aggressive rehabilitation.

9) Central Pontine Myelinolysis: Lesion was found on MRI [**2191-4-5**]
in the setting of ongoing altered mental status. An MRA was
obtained to definitively rule out stroke as cause of this
lesion, and MRA was normal. Per neurology, he likely has CPM due
to rapid correction of hyponatremia earler in his hospital
course. CPM is an irreversible process, and neurology consult
attributed his mental status to CPM; however the patient was
quite alert and oriented on the days immediately prior to
discharge, which indicates that he has not suffered an
irreversible insult.

## Drug Rash: The patient developed a wide-spread, erythematous,
confluent macular rash on [**4-12**]. A dermatology consult was
obtained, and the rash was attributed to a drug reaction. Keppra
and captopril were thought to be most the likely causes of the
rash, and both were discontinued.  The rash had largely resolved
by the time of discharge, and the patient should be considered
allergic to keppra.

## Tachycardia: Patient was tachycardic in 110s-120s for much of
his hospital course, likely due to his high-output cardiac
failure from wet BeriBeri and persistent fevers. Ultimately he
was placed on metoprolol with great improvement in his heart
rate to the 90s. Metoprolol 25mg TID should be continued as long
as he remains tachycardic, unless he becomes hypotensive to
SBP&lt;100.

## Nutrition: The patient was given tube feeds via gastric
dobhoff. On the day prior to discharge he had a PEG placed at
the bedside. This PEG can be used for tube feeds starting in the
afternoon of [**4-16**]. This PEG should not be removed until after
[**2191-5-16**].

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted with profound weakness and found to have
severe thiamine and pyridoxine deficiency.  You were treated for
alcohol withdrawal and mental status changes likely due to
aspiration pneumonia.  You have been followed closely by
neurology and will need ongoing follow up with them.  You will
need to continue with aggressive physical therapy.

We have started you on nutritional supplements and anti-seizure
medications as shown below.

If you develop any chest pain, shortness of breath, mental
status changes, fevers or any other general worsening of
condition, please call your PCP or come directly to the ED.

Brief Hospital Course:

1. NEURO: Workup included a lumbar puncture with RBC 21 and WBC
166 with lymphocytic predominance (prot 72, gluc 60). MRI Head,
C, and T spine with contrast that showed increased T2 signal at
multiple C and T levels and cerebellar peduncle, medulla. EMG
was consistent with spinal process and did not show
demyelination peripherally. Differential diagnosis included
infectious, postinfectious and inflammatory.

Treatment: Patient was started on solumedrol 1g IV q24 on
[**2106-9-14**] for total of 14 day course. He was switched to
prednisone [**9-21**] then resumed solumedrol [**9-22**] when repeat MRI
brain showed increased inflammation (restricted diffusion in
enlarging lesion in L internal capsule measuring ~1 cm. New
lesion in L middle cerebellar peduncle. Unchaged T2
hyperintensity in pontomedullary junction and nonenhancing T2
hyperintensity noted in cervical and thoracic cord). Repeat MRI
of head, C and T spine were improved on [**9-27**]; although T2
hyperintense lesions remain within the left internal capsule,
left middle cerebellar peduncle, and at the pontomedullary
junction, all of the lesions are considerably improved and show
no mass effect or enhancement. Marked interval improvement in
the appearance of T2-signal abnormalities in the cervical and
thoracic cords, including reduced expansile mass effect among
the cervical lesions. Repeat LP performed by fluro on [**2106-9-29**]
showed RBC [**Numeric Identifier 68969**] WBC 671 Prot 136* Gluc 84 which shows
improvement. Oligoclonal bands were again negative in the CSF.

Final diagnosis was myelitis/rhombencephalitis of unclear
etiology. Based on this admission, we were unable to
differntiate between ADEM versus first presentation of multiple
sclerosis. He will follow longitudinally with an outpatient
neurologist who specializes in demyelinating diseases Dr.

Brief Hospital Course:

# Neurology: she was admitted to the NeuroICU with Q1H neuro
checks. Given the extent of the bleed, she was started on
Mannitol with bolus and maintenance q6h Na/Osm checks. Repeat
NCHCT the next day showed possible slight worsening and more
shift, and was given another bolus of mannitol 120g and
continued on higher dose maintenance 75mg QID. This was
eventually weaned off. On [**2161-4-20**], repeat NCHCT demonstrated
possible worsening edema and despite a lack of clinical change,
she was restarted on the Mannitol therapy.  She remained in the
ICU from [**Date range (1) 104305**].
Sedation was weaned off on Hospital Day (HD) 2, but patient was
not arousable and demonstrated right shoulder twitching.
Continuous EEG monitoring demonstrated frequent R-sided PLEDs.
Keppra was started to suppress these discharges but there was no
clinical change. Ativan was added to further suppress PLEDs but
again there was no change. The ativan was eventually weaned off.
Keppra was continued at 750mg TID.  On transfer to the STEP-DOWN
unit on [**4-22**], she remained unarousable and unable to open her
eyes even to noxious stimuli as well as demonstrating posturing
in the RUE and withdrawal in all other extremities. There was
some spontaneous movement noted on the left but not on the
right.  The patient was transferred out of the Neuro ICU on
hyperosmolar therapy with mannitol. A repeat NCHCT revealed no
change in mass effect or shift. Her clinical status remained the
same: she would open her eyes to noxious stimuli, have intact
brainstem reflexes, and withdraw with all four limbs with less
withdrawal of the right arm. Mannitol was weaned slowly. Her
blood pressure was maintained with an SBP goal &lt; 160.  She had a
repeat EEG on [**5-21**] that showed no seizures, so keppra was
stopped.  This medication change and the introduction of
amantadine made the patient more alert and awake and she even
would occasionally whisper a 1-word answer to a question asked
or follow some commands like open your eyes, move your arm etc.

TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES:

Patient will need to be monitored for alertness and have her
amantadine uptitrated as needed.

Brief Hospital Course:

1) Neuro:  He underwent a CT head revealing no new pathology and
EEG revealing mild encephalopathy.  He was loaded with Dilantin,
later converted to Keppra IV.  On HD#1 patient was noted to have
multiple episodes of low amplitude high frequency R &gt; L
extremities shaking with extensor posturing.  Given clinical
concern for sz activity by the intensivist team, he was treated
with a total of 11mg of ativan. He did not have further seizures
on continuous EEG monitoring for the next two days.

On [**2134-11-13**] the patient was extubated and was able to follow
commands.  He was transferred to the neurology step-down unit on
[**2134-11-17**]. While on the step-down unit, he was awake and alert.
He was oriented to person and place and when asked more directly
can identify that it is winter and [**Month (only) 1096**].  He follows
commands and converses quite well. His neurologic exam on day of
transfer was also significant for residual right-sided
hemiparesis from his prior stroke.

2) CV: Atrial fibrillation with intermittent hypertension to
180s systolic.  Treated with esmolol gtt/metoprolol bridge and
hydralazine PO.  TTE showed LAD, EF 50-55% with mild dilatation
and mild aortic root dilatation with 2+MR, 3+ severe TR, and
significant PR.  ROMI was completed, with peak troponin of 0.05,
felt to be due to renal failure and w/o ekg correlate.

Regarding anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation, he was
started on aspirin 325 mg daily after transfer to the neurology
step-down unit with the plan to transition to coumadin on
[**2134-11-28**] which is 3 weeks from the retroperitoneal bleed.

3) RESP.  Patient was intubated in the ED.  He was found to have
a LUL PNA on CXR, along with WBC/tachypnea and respiratory
distress, for which he was empirically treated with Vanco/Zosyn,
which was narrowed to Levofloxacin after organism on sputum was
identified as MSSA.  With his bleeding he again spiked fevers
and his antibiotic coverage was expanded to Vanco/Zosyn.  He was
extubated on [**2134-11-13**] and his antibiotics were changed to
Linezolid PO for a likely 10 day course.

Discharge Medications:

1. Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID
(3 times a day).
2. Famotidine 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

3. Levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2
times a day).
4. Clonidine 0.1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a
day).
5. Lisinopril 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

6. Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a
day) as needed for constipation.
7. Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2
times a day).
8. Bisacodyl 5 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) Sig: Two (2)
Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for
constipation.
9. Aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
10. Diltiazem HCl 30 mg Tablet Sig: 1.5 Tablets PO QID (4 times
a day).
11. Simethicone 80 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet,
Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for flatulence.
12. HydrALAzine 15 mg IV Q4H:PRN If SBP&gt;180

Discharge Condition:

Mental Status: Awake, alert. Oriented to self, place.  When
asked, he knows it is winter and often knows it is [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2133**]. Unable to state DOW. Can identify objects correctly.  Can
follow simple commands.
Neuro exam is significant for mild dysarthria, motor weakness
throughout (R&gt;L), and has right pronator drift.
He is unable to ambulate without assistance.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted with seizure-like activity and fever.  You
were initially treated in the ICU.  You were started on Keppra
for seizure prophylaxis.  You were treated for antibiotics for
pneumonia.  You had bleeding within your abdomen and you
required blood transfusion.  Regarding anticoagulation for your
atrial fibrillation, you were started on aspirin which will be
transitioned to coumadin on [**2134-11-28**].

Brief Hospital Course:

#. seizures:

The patient presented after generalized seizures, complicated by
tongue biting and hematoma. Head CT showed left-sided
intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage.   It was unknown
whether bleeding was the precipitating event, followed by
seizure due to parenchymal irritation; or, if seizure occurred
initially and trauma sustained during the convulsion led to
bleeding. The patient was loaded with Dilantin and then
initiated on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis since this does not
interact with coumadin. He had no further seizure activity int
he ICU. After transfer to the medical floor, the patient had an
episode of lower extremity shaking while asleep in a chair,
witnessed only by wife. This was thought unlikely to represent
seizure activity, and more likely myoclonic jerks during sleep.
Neurology was called to see patient at this time. 20 minute EEG
was done, showing no epileptiform activity. The patient will
continue on Keppra for at least 6 months. He will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in neurology.

#. Retroperitoneal Bleed:

The patient was eventually safely anticoagulated and INR was 3.0
on day of discharge. The patient's coumadin was being held for
supratherapeutic INR prior to discharge. PT and PTT are
elevated, likely due to poor nutritional status. INR will need
to be monitored daily and coumadin adjusted appropriately to
maintain goal range 2.5-3.5.  He should have daily INR checks
and adjustment of dose to maintain INR 2.5-3.5.  At the time of
discharge, he was restarted on coumadin 4.0 mg daily.
His hematocrit is currently 27.9 and stable.

#. HTN: The patient was continued on metoprolol and Imdur.

Discharge Medications:

1. Levetiracetam 1,000 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a
day.
2. Levobunolol 0.5 % Drops Sig: One (1) Drop Ophthalmic [**Hospital1 **] (2
times a day).
3. Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig:
Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for
wheeze.
4. Colchicine 0.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times
a day).
5. Pravastatin 80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
6. Pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) Sig: One
(1) Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) PO Q24H (every 24 hours).
7. Isosorbide Mononitrate 30 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr
Sig: One (1) Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr PO at bedtime.
8. Metoprolol Succinate 100 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr
Sig: One (1) Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr PO once a day.
9. Zetia 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
10. Warfarin 4 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.

Discharge Condition:

Awake, oriented to person, location, and year.  Tangential
speech, dysarthric, but fluent language.  Naming and repetition
intact, follows commands.  EOMI, right lower facial droop,
tongue midline.  No pronator drift, 5/5 strength in upper
extremities bilaterally, [**4-2**] in lower extremity bilaterally.
Upgoing toe on R.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted for seizures and intracranial hemorrhage. You
required intubation to assist your breathing. When your
bloodthinner was stopped, you had a stroke. You then had a large
hematoma requiring surgery. You will go to a rehab facility to
help build back your strength and skills.

Please continue your medications as prescribed and follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (neurology) as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (vascular)
as directed.  Return to the Emergency Department immediately for
any new weakness or numbness, difficulty speaking, visual
changes, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath.

Brief Hospital Course:

She was screened for rehab on [**4-9**], and was transferred via
ambulance to [**Hospital **] Rehab on [**2166-4-11**].

??????	Take all of your medications as ordered.  You do not have to
take pain medication unless it is needed.  It is important that
you are able to cough, breathe deeply, and is comfortable enough
to walk.
??????	Do not use alcohol while taking pain medication.
??????	Medications that may be prescribed include:
-Narcotic pain medication such as Dilaudid (hydromorphone).
	-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or
Docusate). If you become constipated, try products such as
Dulcolax, Milk of Magnesia, first, and then Magnesium Citrate or
Fleets enema if needed). Often times, pain medication and
anesthesia can cause constipation.
??????	Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and
Ibuprofen etc, as this can increase your chances of bleeding.

are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec,
Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach
irritation.  Make sure to take your steroid medication with
meals, or a glass of milk.

ACTIVITY:

The first few weeks after you are discharged you may feel tired
or fatigued. This is normal. You should become a little stronger
every day. Activity is the most important measure you can take
to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself
again. In general:
??????	Follow the activity instructions given to you by your doctor
and therapist.
??????	Increase your activity slowly; do not do too much because you
are feeling good.
??????	You may resume sexual activity as your tolerance allows.
??????	If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing
activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and
begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
??????	DO NOT DRIVE until you speak with your physician.
??????	Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your
physician.
??????	Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and
push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy
objects, or straining at stool.
??????	Do your breathing exercises every two hours.
??????	Use your incentive spirometer 10 times every hour, that you
are awake.

WHEN TO CALL YOUR SURGEON:

With any surgery there are risks of complications. Although your
surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these
complications developing. These complications include:
infection, blood clots, or neurological changes. Call your

What was the underlying cause of the episode? Is it scleroderma?
        </clinician_question>
        <note_excerpt>
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

Status post right heart catheterization, he was transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring as
well as titration of his Flolan.  While in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, the Swan-Ganz catheter remained in place for
continuous monitoring.  He had a trial of sildenafil 25 mg
p.o. t.i.d. which demonstrated a drop in his pulmonary artery
pressure of approximately 10%, demonstrated increased cardiac
output, and a slight drop in his systolic blood pressure.
However, he had difficulty tolerating the sildenafil
secondary to severe headache.  Also while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, his Flolan was titrated up to a dose of
23 ng/kg/minute.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

1. Scleroderma with CREST syndrome diagnosed approximately 20
years ago due to sclerodactyly.  Associated pulmonary
hypertension, on Flolan since [**2139-5-21**].  Pulmonary
function tests in [**2140-1-29**] showed worsening
restrictive function with FEV1 of 1.68 liters, FVC of 42%
predicted, elevated FEV1/FVC ratio at 118% predicted, total
lung capacity 49% predicted, residual volume 60% predicted,
and DLCO of 28% predicted.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

After he failed his trial of sildenafil, we attempted to
titrate up his Flolan dose while on the floor.  However, he
did not tolerate the increased Flolan dose secondary to
dizziness, headache, and nausea.  He also underwent
esophageal balloon studies under the hypothesis that perhaps
some component of his dyspnea was due to chest wall
restriction secondary to scleroderma.  However, his
esophageal balloon studies showed relatively normal elastic
recoil of the chest wall and slightly increased recoil of
the lung consistent with interstitial edema/effusion or perhaps
early inflammatory/fibrotic changes from scleroderma.

It was postulated as well that perhaps some component of the
patient's dyspnea was secondary to his history of right
ventricular CHF.  Therefore, he was diuresed aggressively
while on the floor with Lasix intravenous, Bumex, metolazone,
spironolactone.  He continued to be followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
of the Advanced Heart Failure Clinic, and she and her staff
made recommendations as to changes to the medications
diuretic regimen in order to increase his subjective sense of
breathing improvement.

It was noted also that the patient had not been using the
recommended ice packs while using his Flolan at home.  These
ice packs help increase the efficacy and half-life of Flolan.
He was educated aggressively on the need to use the ice packs
with his Flolan in order to enhance his breathing.  Patient
had been tried on Bosentan in the past.  Per the patient, he
felt no subjective improvement with Bosentan alone.  It is
postulated that perhaps, Flolan and Bosentan together would
provide subjective improvement in his dyspnea.  He will
likely try this regimen as an outpatient.

Finally, the patient underwent a repeat chest CT scan in
order ascertain whether the ground-glass opacities
demonstrated on his [**2140-2-2**] CT scan were indicated of
congestive heart failure or whether there was a secondary
process, possibly alveolitis, going on as well.  Initial read
of the chest CT demonstrated persistent ground-glass
opacities. Further followup will be required to determine if
this due to residual interstitial edema or early alveolitis.

2. Right ventricular congestive heart failure:  Patient had a
recent echocardiogram, which demonstrated preserved ejection
fraction.  It is unclear whether the mechanism of his CHF was
due to diastolic dysfunction alone or perhaps mediated by
severe pulmonary hypertension.  Initially, he was continued
on his outpatient regimen of Zaroxolyn 2.5 mg 3x a week,
Bumex, aldactone with Lasix added on an as needed basis for
continued diuresis.

3. Acute renal failure:  Upon admission, the patient had a
slight bump in his creatinine most likely secondary to
prerenal versus diuretic-induced causes.  He had no evidence
of urinary sediment to suggest sclerodermal renal crisis.
His creatinine improved with fluid hydration while in the
Intensive Care Unit.  It remained relatively stable during
continued diuresis on the floor.

[**2139-5-19**] CT chest:

IMPRESSION:

1. Basilar-predominant pulmonary fibrosis, most compatible with
fibrotic NSIP related to the patient's known diagnosis of
scleroderma. Associated
esophageal dilatation also related to scleroderma is also noted.

2. Extensive new ground-glass opacities seen throughout both
lungs, most
apparent at the right apex. This is most likely infectious in
etiology.
Given the history of HIV, PCP should be considered. Atypical
infectious
processes such as mycoplasma or viral pneumonias are also
likely. Bacterial or fungal pneumonia is considered less likely
given the radiographic appearance. Of note, the history of NSIP
raises the additional possibility of acute interstitial
pneumonia, though this would be a diagnosis of exclusion.

Brief Hospital Course:

45 year old male with HIV (on HAART, CD488 and viral load &lt;75),
Raynaud's, hypothyroidism, scleroderma, chronic renal
insufficiency interstitial lung disease who initially presented
[**2139-5-15**] with high fevers, chills, cough and post-tussive
emesis X1 day, transferred to MICU for recurrent fever, hypoxia
and tachypnea.

This patient had a long and storied course here at [**Hospital1 18**] with
several transfers in and out of the MICU for bouts of
hypotension and tachypnea most likley related to underlying
illness and/or medicaion effects. He never required pressor
support or mechanical ventilation. A problem based list is found
below as well as transitional issues that need follow up in the
immediate future.

# Fevers/ Hypoxia: Overall workup for his illness has been
negative thus far including Flu, respiratory viral panel, urine
legionalla antigen, Blood(bacterial and fungal) cultures, 2
negative PCP smears, serum cryptococcal and stool cultures on
admission. His presentation is most consistent with a
respiratory illness including atypical/viral pneumonia. Patient
was improving then acutely decompensated requiring MICU transfer
and there was concern of aspiration/HCAP consequently was
started on Vanc/Cefepime for broad coverage. He continues to
improve on vanc and cefepime and should continue vancomycin and
cefepime antibiotics until [**2139-5-30**] for a total of 8 days.
Patient was empirically treated for pcp on admission, then
following bronch BAL negative for pcp was decreased to
prophlaxic dosing. The next day he developed increasing RR
consequently decision was made to treat for pcp (as well as HCAP
Vanc/Cefepime as above). He will complete a 21 day course of
bactrim treatment on [**2139-6-8**] after which he will reduce his
dose to prophylaxic dose until his CD4 count recovers. He was
afebrile with no oxygen requirement on the day of discharge.

# Transaminitis: Patient had mildly elevated transaminases that
were initially thought to be indicative of a viral process. Have
been stable for the duration of his hospitalization. Will need
to be trended as outpatient and consideration for further work
up will be left to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 8469**].

# Abdominal pain: On admission patient had one episode of acute
abdominal pain. He underwent stat CT ab/pelvis which
demonstrated a thickened appendix but no acute pathology. His
abdominal pain resolved quickly and etiology is unclear.
- Please refer to results section for CT scan of thickened
appendix (broad differential) and work-up will need to be
completed as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital with fever and cough. During
your stay, many tests and images were ordered to determine the
cause of your sickness. A CT scan of your chest revealed that
you had a pneumonia, which we think was caused by a virus. You
appear to be recovering from this viral infection. Because your
lungs and immune system are weaker after this infection, we are
prescribing two antibiotics to prevent you from getting another
kind of pneumonia caused by bacteria. Otherwise, please continue
with your medications as usual. You are also being set up with
home oxygen to use until your lungs recover.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

He was referred to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**5-18**] for cardiac catheterization with intervention.  The
patient arrived on [**5-18**] chest pain free, good blood
pressure and underwent cardiac catheterization on [**5-19**]
through the left groin site.  The patient's cardiac
catheterization again revealed significant 3-vessel disease.
The patient underwent a proximal right coronary artery
intervention/stent of 3.5-mm X 15-mm stent was deployed in
the proximal right coronary artery.  In the holding area,
after the stent, the patient was noted to have some oozing
from the left groin site.  Pressure was held.  Subsequently,
the patient developed a drop in his blood pressure to 67/50
and a decrease in his heart rate to the 50s.  Thought this
was secondary to vagal tone after his right coronary artery
lesions and pressure on his groin.  The patient was given
2 amps of Atropine and was bolused with 2 liters of saline;
however, due to persistent hypotension, the patient was
started on dopamine.  The patient subsequently developed an
supraventricular tachycardia with a heart rate into the 160s
and rate-related ischemia with ST depressions in V1 to V3,
requiring Levophed transiently.

The patient was emergently taken back to catheterization for
a re-look.  At that point, the patient was intervened from
the right groin, and given his decreased blood pressure and
ischemic changes, he went for re-look catheterization which
showed no evidence of re-occlusion.  At that point, a
hematocrit was drawn which showed a hematocrit of 23.5.  The
patient's hematocrit was 32 at an outside hospital on
[**5-13**].  The patient was given a total of 6 units of packed
red blood cells; two in the holding area, two with the
re-look catheterization, and two in the operating room.

The patient was taken to the operating room emergently for
exploration of his left groin site for evidence of hematoma.
The patient was intubated in the operating room prior to
surgery.  In the operating room, it was negative for
hematoma, and the patient was noted to have a question of
hematemesis with pooling of blood in the oropharynx while in
the operating room; although, nasogastric tube in place was
returning bilious, the patient was transfused to the Coronary
Care Unit post groin exploration from the Postanesthesia Care
Unit intubated with marginal blood pressures.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  (a)  Ischemia:  The patient was admitted
with unstable angina, status post right coronary artery
stent.  The patient had negative enzymes times three.  The
patient remained chest pain free after the intervention and
was started on aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor.  Eventually,
when blood pressure tolerated Lopressor and Zestril were
added and titrated subsequently.  The patient to be
discharged on adequate doses of aspirin 325 mg p.o.,
Plavix 75 mg p.o., Lipitor 10 mg, atenolol 50 mg p.o., and
Zestril 10 mg p.o.  Again, no further episodes of chest pain
or jaw pain during his hospitalization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

The patient is a 54-year-old
male with known coronary artery disease who was admitted to
[**Hospital6 2910**] on [**2144-9-9**], for elective
cardiac catheterization.  Past medical history is significant
for coronary artery disease status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent of the left
anterior descending coronary artery in [**2138**].  Upon arrival to
the [**Hospital6 2910**], the patient reported
constant four out of ten chest pain with radiation to his jaw
since the previous evening, [**2144-9-8**].  He received
morphine prior to catheterization.  Catheterization
demonstrated a tight LAD lesion, 70% proximal, 90% mid LAD,
resulting in an inability to see his previous LAD stent.  The
patient continued to have chest pain status post
catheterization with no electrocardiogram changes evident.
Left ventriculogram during catheterization showed normal size
and good contraction of all wall segments.  He was started on
a nitroglycerin intravenous drip at 80 mcg/minute, Aggrastat
and heparin.  This resulted in a decrease in his chest pain
to one to two out of ten in severity.  Labs drawn at [**Hospital6 14475**] showed a hematocrit of 39.0,
creatinine kinase of 126, troponin 0.06.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
therapeutic catheterization.  Upon arrival vital signs were
97.8, blood pressure 140 to 160 over 90 to 100, heart rate in
the 60's with normal sinus rhythm, oxygen saturation 98 to
100% on two liters nasal cannula oxygen.  Prior to
catheterization at [**Hospital1 69**],
patient received fentanyl 25 mcg for his discomfort and
Versed.  Therapeutic catheterization at [**Hospital1 190**] showed left main coronary artery disease with
mid ostial disease, left anterior descending with 60% ostial
lesion, moderate 50% mid disease prior to stent, 95% tight
focal lesion in old stent prior to first major diagonal
branch.  A Cypher stent was deployed in the proximal/middle
LAD.  Status post catheterization, the patient had
serosanguinous blood discharge and ooze from around sheaths
upon arrival to the floor.  Tunnel sheaths were pulled with
systolic blood pressures in the range of 140's to 150's.
Cardiac fellow applied pressure.  The patient complained of
recurrent pain so additional doses of morphine were given.
At this time then his right groin developed a large hematoma.
Subsequently, nitroglycerin and Aggrastat were discontinued.
Intravenous fluids were started with aggressive fluid
hydration.  Stat hematocrit value was drawn with a value of
34.9.  The patient's hematoma continued to expand and he
continued to complain of pain.  As the hematoma and groin
continued to ooze bloody discharge, a vascular groin C-clamp
was applied.  The patient was transferred to the Coronary
Care Unit for further hemodynamic monitoring.  Upon arrival
to the CCU, he complained of severe pain, greater than ten
out of ten in severity.  Upon arrival he then received
another 10 mg of morphine, 1 mg of Versed, 50 mcg of fentanyl
and Phenergan 25 mg IV.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

2.  Right groin hematoma resulting in blood loss anemia:
Vascular Surgery consultation was obtained status post
coronary catheterization and development of large right groin
hematoma.  Vascular Surgery recommended a lower extremity
ultrasound with results as above, namely, ultrasound
demonstrated a large right groin hematoma, no evidence of
pseudo-aneurysm or arteriovenous fistula formation.  In the
Coronary Care Unit, serial hematocrits were obtained,
patient's blood pressure and hemodynamics were checked
serially and peripheral pulse checks were done q. one hour.
Due to anemia secondary to blood loss, the patient required
multiple blood transfusions for stabilization of his blood
volume and maintenance of hematocrit greater than 30.  All
told he received five units of blood.  Initially also he was
kept on bed rest with Foley catheter in place and his right
leg immobilized.  His pain was treated with morphine,
fentanyl and Versed initially.  After several days it was
switched over to Vicodin as the patient uses Vicodin at home
for control of his lower back pain.  Repeat ultrasound was
obtained on [**2144-9-4**], with no evidence of hematoma
expansion, no evidence of pseudo-aneurysm or arteriovenous
fistula formation.  Upon discharge, the patient's hematoma
size was stabilized.  Serial hematocrits had been stable
above 33 to 36 for several days.  As the patient's hematoma
resolved within a prolonged period of immobilization, it was
felt that discharge to a rehabilitation facility where he
could work on functional mobility and increasing gait and
balance was warranted.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:

Fair.  Right groin hematoma size
stable.  Hematocrit stabilized.  Unable to demonstrate full
pre-hospital functionality, so discharge to rehab.

Brief Hospital Course:

REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:

75 F w CAD s/p RCA stent [**2116**], COPD, RA, seizure disorder, HTN,
PVD, p/w several weeks of worsening SOB. Ruled in for STEMI at
OSH &amp; subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.

ACUTE DIAGNOSES:

# NSTEMI: Found to have peak troponin to 2.76 at OSH with T wave
changes in V2-V5.
Transferred on heparin gtt. Pt was continued on metoprolol,
statin, ASA. Loaded with plavix prior to cath on [**2123-1-14**] which
showed minimal in-stent restenosis of RCA stent, as well as a
tight ostial LAD on which PCI could not be performed (too
difficult). Pt had radial access for arterial cath; venous
access in groin difficult to obtain. Patient hypotensive during
case, requiring dopamine gtt temporarily (now off pressors).
Afterward, patient developed rapidly expanding left groin
hematoma. She was given protamine. Hematoma now stable,
hematocrit 29 on discharge (stable for days). Patient also
dyspnea, requiring O2 4L per NC, and appears somewhat volume
overloaded. Patient admitted to CCU for diuresis and observation
overnight. B/L LE US were negative for hematoma, non-contrast CT
abdomen and pelvis were negative for RP bleed.  In the CCU,
patient was continued on ASA 325mg PO, Atorvastatin 80mg PO
daily, Metoprolol tartrate 50mg PO BID, plavix.  Amlodipine was
discontinued and lisinopril was held due to hypotension/low
urine output.  On the floor, patient started on diovan 40 mg,
which should be held if her blood pressure is less than 100.
Discharged on full ASA, plavix, metoprolol succinate 100 mg QD.

# LEFT GROIN HEMATOMA: Developed apparent right groin hematoma
which was treated with protamine. CT [**Last Name (un) 103**] showed pt actually had
left groin hematoma, none on right. No pseudoaneurysm/RP bleed.
Hematoma and hematocrit remained stable throughout CCU &amp; floor
course. DPs dopplerable BL. Patient was maintained on
pneumoboots instead of heparin sq prophylaxis.

Discharge Instructions:

Ms. [**Known lastname 13143**], it was a pleasure to participate in your care
while you were at [**Hospital1 18**].  You came to the hospital for shortness
of breath over hte past month. You were transferred from
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital after it was found that you had a small heart
attack. While you were here, you had a cardiac catheterization
which showed a blockage.  We were unable to treat the blockage
because your blood pressure was low during the procedure and you
need to go to the cardiac intensive care unit.  While you were
there, you were treated with some intravenous diuretics.  Your
urine output temporarily dropped, but by the time you were
transferred back to the medical floor, your urine production
improved.  You had an ultrasound of your heart that showed
slight worsening of your heart failure.

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.

Brief Hospital Course:

This is a 76 year old man with history of HTN, dyslipidemia who
presented with chest pain, found to have an STEMI, taken for
cardiac cath and BMS was placed to his RCA.

1. STEMI - Patient presented quickly to the hospital after an
episode of chest pain. He was found to have ST elevations in his
inferior leads with reciprocal changes consistent with acute
IMI, and found to have RCA lesion s/p BMS placement during
cardiac catheterization on [**2136-4-17**]. He was transferred to the CCU
for observation post procedure. He received integrillin gtt
after his procedure and was started on plavix after the
procedure. His enzymes peaked at 7pm after procedure with CK 52,
Trop T of 2.78. His ST changes were resolved on EKGs post
procedure. ECHO post procedure showed EF 45-50%, mild
inf/lateral akinesis. Post procedure EKG showing resolution of
ST elevations, no indication of stent rethrombosis or recurrent
MI. He had a small mild right groin hematoma post procedure
which remained stable with resolving ecchymosis upon discharge.
His pulses remained good. He was stable and transferred to the
medical floor. He was optimized on his medical regimen. He was
started on plavix 75mg PO daily, increased to 325mg PO daily
aspirin, lipitor 80mg PO daily. He was titrated up on his
metoprolol to 37.5mg PO TID and his BP remained SBP 100-110s
with HR in 60s. He will follow up with his cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], where he can be started on an ACE inhibitor as his BP
allows.

2. Hematuria - The patient had urinary obstruction on
presentation likely 2/2 blood clots which resolved with CBI in
the CCU. Pt has hx of prostate CA s/p brachytherapy and lupron.
CBI was stopped after patient started making clear urine.
However, he had new hematuria likely secondary to trauma from
foley on [**2136-4-18**]. Urology was consulted and patient was restarted
on CBI with clear urine on [**2136-4-19**]. His foley was discontinued on
morning of admission and patient was able to void on own without
hematuria or pain by discharge.

3. Anemia - Patient with decreased Hct from 30.4 -&gt; 27s with
nadir with Hct of 25. Likely blood loss from R groin hematoma,
with no indications of tense hematoma, active bleed, or GIB.
Patient also with some blood loss from hematuria. His Hct
remained stable at discharge at 27.4. He was started on niferex
150mg PO daily on discharge.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital when you developed chest pain,
were found to have an acute heart attack and taken for cardiac
catheterization where a stent was placed in one of your heart
vessels. You were stable after your procedure and your heart
medications were optimized. You were also started on iron
supplementation for anemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

At this point, the patient was intubated.  EKG showed a right
bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, deep
ST segment depressions in V2 through V4 suggestive of an
anterior septal myocardial infarction.  There is no
comparison EKG available.  The patient was given a heparin
intravenous bolus and no 2B 3A inhibitor secondary to the
history of head trauma.  The patient was sent to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for urgent catheterization.

Initial arterial blood gas upon arrival at the [**Hospital1 346**] was 7.16, 48, 76, and the patient
had a lactate of 4.5.  The patient had coffee ground on NG
lavage which was guaiac negative.

Upon catheterization, it was found that the patient had a
large patent foramen ovale with no left to right shunting.
He received three ampules of bicarbonate for worsening
acidosis.  His anatomy showed aneurysmal left main and left
anterior descending.  His wedge pressure was elevated at 24.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, which was
complicated by a left groin bleed.  The left anterior
descending artery was stented.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

Briefly, the patient is a 57 year old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease status
post stent placement in [**2170**], who presented following
ventricular fibrillation arrest and prolonged resuscitation
with EKG changes suggestive of an anterior septal myocardial
infarction in the setting of increased troponin.  The patient
is status post an urgent catheterization with stent to the
left anterior descending and transfer to the Cardiac Care
Unit in cardiogenic shock with intra-aortic balloon pump in
place.

1.  Cardiovascular:  A) Coronary artery disease:  The patient
has a history of coronary artery disease status post stent to
the left ramus in [**2170**], now with EKG and enzymes suggestive
of anterior septal myocardial infarction with stent placement
to the left anterior descending.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled
and initial CK was 129.  CPK reached a peak at midnight on
[**10-5**] at 4,087 and the MB peaked on [**10-4**] at 77.

The patient was treated with aspirin 325 mg, Plavix 75 mg;
Lipitor 10 mg.  During his hospital stay, Imdur was added on
[**10-9**].

B)  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by
cardiogenic shock requiring pressors in the Cardiac Care
Unit, which were ultimately weaned off within the first two
days of hospitalization and intra-aortic balloon pump was
also discontinued.

The patient had an echocardiogram on [**10-6**], which
revealed an ejection fraction of 20 to 30%.  His course was
complicated by episodes of hypertension particularly during
the time while we were attempting to extubate the patient.
Pressures increased up to 230/110 transiently, which were
reversed with Lopressor.  The patient was on a regimen of
high dose Lopressor and Captopril during his stay which was
switched to once a day dosing of Enalapril 40 and Atenolol
100 a few days prior to discharge.  The patient was also
started on 10 of Norvasc for good blood pressure control.

Upon discharge, the pressures were consistently stable in the
120s to 130.

C)  Rhythm:  The patient is status post ventricular
fibrillation arrest.  He was seen by Electrophysiology
attending who recommended defibrillator placement.  He had an
abnormal signal average ECG on [**10-12**], abnormal for long
filtered QRS.  An ICD was placed on [**10-17**], and the patient is
scheduled to follow-up with Electrophysiology Service, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], as an outpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:

77 yo F with HTN, hyperlipidemia presents with chest pain,
thought to be anginal. Now s/p drug-eluting stent to RCA.

#Coronary Artery Disease/Unstable Angina: The patient initially
presented to an outside hospital with 10 minutes of chest pain.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Here,
cardiac catherization showed 80% occlusion of the RCA. The
patient was treated with a drug-eluting stent. Catherization was
complicated by hypotension (likely vagal) and a groin hematoma.
The patient was discharged on aspirin, Plavix, pravastatin,
metoprolol, diltiazem, lisinopril, and nitroglycerin. Cardiology
follow-up was arranged.

#Groin hematoma: The patient's cardiac catherization was
complicated by a right groin hematoma. CT abdomen/pelvis
(performed without contrast) was negative for retroperitoneal
bleeding. Ultrasound revealed a possible reversal of flow
without obvious pseudoaneurysm. Reimimaging was considered, but
the patient was improving clinically and hemodynamically, so
this was not pursued. The patient's hematocrit remained stable
throughout her hospital course.

#Hypotension: The patient's catheterization was complicated by
hypotension, likely related to inreased vagal tone.
Consequently, the patient required transient pressor support
with dopamine. This was quickly weaned.

Discharge Instructions:

You came to the hospital to undergo cardiac catheterization. You
were found to have a blockage in the right coronary artery,
which was stented in the catheterization lab.

Your cardiac catherization was complicated by a bruise in your
right groin. At the time of discharge, this bruise had been
stable for 48 hours.

History of Present Illness:

In the cath lab, the patient was noted to have RCA 99% ostial
stenosis; this lesion was stented with bare metal stent with
good result. Her catheterization was complicated by multiple
attempts at venous access which yielded arterial blood. She
developed a large hematoma during the case. Following her cath,
she went to the CCU chest pain free, hemodynamically stable, but
with a large right groin hematoma.

Brief Hospital Course:

Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 78 year old female with inferior ST elevation
myocardial infarction now status post catheterization
complicated by a large right groin hematoma.

#) Status post inferior STEMI - The patient's RCA was found to
be 99% stenosed at catheterization. At that time, she had a bare
metal stent placed with good result.
- She should continue ASA (lifelong) and plavix (for at least
one month and perhaps longer at the discretion of her primary
cardiologist).
- Her groin hematoma on the day of discharge was stable and not
impeding her movement in any way. Her hematocrit at discharge
was stable, though she did require three units of blood
immediately following her catheterization due to falling
hematocrit at that time.
- She should continue atorvastatin 80 mg daily. Her lipids are
near goal with LDL 98.
- She was discharged on Toprol XL 50 mg to be taken daily as
well as a low-dose ACE inhibitor as she is post myocardial
infarction.
- Her echocardiogram does demonstrate a hyperdynamic ejection
fraction. See the full report for details.
- Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] did not have any concerning arrhythmias on telemetry
during her hospitalization.
- She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4469**], who is her primary care
physician as well as a cardiologist, on [**11-1**]. She will
have labs drawn on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**10-28**], to assess her
electrolytes and renal function.
- Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] was evaluated by physical therapy and deemed safe
for discharge. At the time of discharge, she was hemodynamically
stable and comfortable on room air.

#) Right groin hematoma - As above, the area of eccymosis on day
of discharge was large but stable. There was no evidence of
pseudoaneurysm on physical exam or on ultrasound performed on
[**10-22**]. Her hematocrit was stable on day of discharge, and the
patient's movement was not impeded in any way.
- Immediately following her catheterization, she did received
blood transfusions as above.

Brief Hospital Course:

23-year-old RH woman with a PMH of a prior episode of ascending
weakness and hemiparesis  presents an ascending weakness and
paresthesias 4 years ago. She presented now with a gradually
progressive weakness and numbness/tingling ascending
from her toes and now reaching her arms. These occur in the
context of a recent URI and Diarrhea.

Her exam is remarkable for a low VC for a young athlete. She
also
has marked weakness now in all extremities with strength of [**5-8**]
in all groups. She also has weakness
of neck flexors and extensors. She is areflexic except at the
patellars. Her labs are
unremarkable.

Given this presentation, her symptoms were concerning for
GBS

Patient was admitted to ICU where her respiratory condition
remained normal and stable.

Her CSF was normal:
WBC RBC Polys Lymphs Monos ([**2156-11-25**])
1    0   0     90      10

An EMG was performed on [**2156-11-26**], which was normal.
The likelihood of a GBS diagnosis was very low given the normal
CSF and EMG.

MRI total spine with contrast showed no evidence of mass,
infarct, or demyelinating disease. MRI brain with contrast
showed no evidence of mass, infarct, or demyelinating disease.
Patient will be re-evaluated in clinic.
Differential diagnosis remains conversion disorder or
reactivation of a viral process she had years ago.

Discharge Diagnosis:

still unclear; we could during this admission affirm that the
diagnosis of Guillain-[**Location (un) **] Syndrome is unlikely

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted with weakness concerning for the diagnosis of
Guillain-[**Location (un) **]. Howerever, your exams, such as cerebral spinal
fluid analysis and electromyography exam  were normal, making
this diagnosis unlikely. You should have a follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in the clinic.

History of Present Illness:

Patient was being seen by ophthalmology starting [**2145-11-23**] for
papilledema, OU. LP was done in [**2145-12-7**] to rule out increased IC
pressure. LP results then showed Total Protein, CSF 66* mg/dL,
WBC 1, and OP 145 mm H20. MRI performed showed chronic left
parietal stroke and no mass lesion. Patient went to Aruba with
his wife. On [**2145-12-22**], patient was diagnosed with bronchitis in
Aruba, presenting with nonproductive cough, no fever, no nausea
and vomiting, no other complaints. Patient was given Zithromax x
5 days.
6 days PTA, patient complained of diplopia, both eyes, even when
either one is covered, persistent, worse on downward gaze but
present in all directions. His wife also noted a progressive
change in the quality of his voice, which was becoming more
nasal
and generalized weakness more on the lower extremities but also
involving the face. He also reported numbness and tingling at
his
fingertips. He was brought to a hospital in Aruba but diagnosis
was not made. Patient flew back home with his wife for
assessment
and management of symptoms. 1 day PTA, patient fell on his right
side while walking to the bathroom. No loss of consciousness. No
convulsive activity. Laceration noted left eyebrow with multiple
hematomas and ecchymoses more on the left. He was then brought
to
[**Hospital1 18**] for admission. Day after admission, bilateral
ophthalmoplegia noted.

Brief Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the oncology service after a fall
and opthalmoplegia noted. Neurology was consulted and made the
diagnosis of [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] variant of guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome
(acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy) and the
patient was transferred to the neurology service and treated
with a 5-day course of IVIG. He recovered swallowing function
and was able to eat. He recovered some up and downgaze by the
time of discharge.

Neurologically, it remains to be seen how much more improvement
is to be expected, as this variant of GBS does not improve as
reliably. He should be monitored for signs of urinary retention
and constipation. At baseline, he is severely demented but
pleasant - he requires his wife's assistance for ADLs. Neuro
exam shows slight up and down gaze, reactive pupils, areflexia
and slight ataxia on finger-to-nose, in addition to the expected
mental status findings given his dementia.

History of Present Illness:

49 y/o F w/ h/o HCV who presents from [**Hospital3 **] for a
question of Gullian-[**Location (un) **] Syndrome. Patient states that she was
in her USOH until 11 days PTA when she developed a productive
cough. She also developed mild numbness in her fingertips and
soles of her feet. The following day she developed a fever to
102. 7 days PTA she presented to OSH ED with these symptoms. She
was prescribed a course of Azithromycin. She then developed
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after taking the Azithromycin.
She re-presented to the ED and was given IVFs and sent home.
Over the next few days her numbness worsened with spread up her
feet and then her legs. 4 days PTA she presented to her PCP with
complaints of the numbness. She was instructed to go to the ED
if the symptoms worsened. 2 days PTA she presented to [**Hospital **] with complaints of worsening numbness with spread into
her abdomen and her back. She also complained of intermittent
right-sided chest pressure. Initially she had no weakness or
bowel or bladder symptoms. 1 day PTA she developed subjective
weakness while ambulating to the bathroom, feeling as if her
legs gave out from under her. She also had an episode of urinary
incontinence. The numbness spread up her chest as well. She was
seen by neurology and an MRI/MRA brain and LP was performed. MRI
was unremarkable. LP revealed 1 WBC, 500 RBC, 27 protein, 70
glucose. Vital Capacity was 5.3 Liters and she denied SOB. Given
concern for GBS she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] fur further evaluation and
possible plasmapheresis.

Brief Hospital Course:

49 y/o F with progressive numbess following recent infection
concerning for Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome. Currently no respiratory
compromise.

1) Numbness/weakness - pt was monitored for any evidence of
respiratory insufficiency, however had good lung volumes and
inspiratory force on initial evaluation in the ICU.  MRI of her
spine was obtained and was unrevealing.
Work-up was initiated consisting of laboratory evaluation for
vitamin B12 deficiency, syphillis, HIV, Hepatitis-related,
Diabetes-related, thyroid, paraneoplastic (lung nodule on x-ray)
which were all negative.  The patient was transferred to
neurology after being consulted.  On transfer, the patient had a
sensory level to about C5 on the abdomen, and asymmetric sensory
findings on the back up to T10, paraparesis with radicular signs
at C4,5, She also complained of gait ataxia, most likely due to
sensory loss and areflexia. Initial though was a myelopathy with
polyradiculopathy.  GBS was a possible initail diagnosis, but
because the patient had a level, other etiologies were explored.
 Other etiologies included cryglobulinemia because h/o HCV,
mycoplasma (due to previous URI sx), lyme, EBV, or CMV, as well
as a 24hr urine &amp; blood heavy metal screen to look for arsenic.
The patient had recently moved to a new house in early [**Month (only) 116**], two
weeks prior to initial symptoms.  Pt was CMV IgG positive and
EBV IgG positive, but IgM levels were negative and MRI showed no
signs of myelitis.  She was negative for lyme and
cryoglubulinemia.

Throughout the course, the patient had progressive weakness of
both IP/Hamstrings/TA [**1-27**], though weaker on the right compared
to the left.  SHe also had weak deltoids [**2-27**], biceps [**2-27**], though
more weakness on the right than the left.  SHe also had
intermittent increased tone on the left foot.  Repeat LP showed
1WBC 29RBC protein:20 glucose:69.  EMG showed a moderate
sensorimotor demyelination process, however there were some
axonal features as well.  Because the patient had progressive
weakness, the patient was started on IVIG therapy.  Initially
the patient had improvement of symptoms with the IVIG with
return of sensation to her fingers.  She did have episodes of
flushing with the IVIG which was treated with benadryl.  She had
four treatments of IVIG throughout her hospital course.
On HD 7, the blood heavy metal screen showed borderline levels
of arsenic (23, nl is &lt;23).  The suspicion for arsenic was
confirmed with elevated levels in the 24hr urine collection
(164.8 MCG/G CR, nl &lt;50mgc/g CR).  An addiontional random urine
collection was made to determine if the elevated arsenic level
was due to organic arsenic (found in shellfish) or inorganic
arsenic (found in runoff/well water).  The town of [**Location (un) 20756**]
([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 67997**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 67998**]) was notified about the patient, and
inquired about levels of arsenic in their well water.  [**Month (only) 547**]
tests showed no elevated levels or arsenic, however no recent
levels were taken, and they have begun their investigation.

2) Lung nodule: CXR showed a LUL nodule, which chest CT showed a
calcified LUL granuloma.  She has a short smoking history, and
denies and recent weight loss.

Brief Hospital Course:

63 year old male presenting with febrile neutropenia, elevated
creatinine in setting of right axillary abcess while on Bactrim.

1. Neutropenia: Initial differential included post-infectious,
drug-induced/agranulocytosis, primary immune disorders or
hypersplenism. The association with recent Bactrim placed
drug-induced agranulocytosis higher on the differential,
although a rare condition. The patient was placed on neutropenic
precautions and admitted to the ICU. The patient was continued
on Vancomycin and Cefepime for febrile neutropenia coverage. He
was ultimately given leucovorin and G-CSF with improvement in
his neutrophil count, and he was no longer neutropenic. As his
neutrophil count improved, he was transitioned to PO
doxycycyline. He was monitored for 24 hours with normal WBC and
on PO doxycycline only, and he remained stable. He was
discharged with plans for a CBC count within 3 days of
discharge.

3. Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline creatinine.  Patient
had good urine output. Pt received 1L of NS while in ED. Cr from
1.7 to 1.4 to 1.1 following total of 6 lites of normal saline.
Nephrotoxins were avoided.

7. Left Axillary Abscess:

His abscess was thought possibly related to MRSA infection. His
bactrim was discontinued, and he was transitioned to vancomycin
initially. As his WBC count improved, he was transitioned to PO
doxycycyline. Even after his neutrophil count improved, his left
axillary abscess remained without fluctuance or significant
drainage. He was discharged with plans to have follow-up with
his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 3 days of discharge and then follow-up with his
infectious disease team within 2 weeks of discharge. He is to
continue on doxycycline for at least 10 days with plans to have
weekly follow-up of his infection. If his infection persists or
does not improve, he may need surgical evaluation for incision
and drainage and/or antibiotic regimen changes.

Discharge Medications:

1. Mupirocin Calcium 2 % Cream Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2
times a day).
Disp:*30 grams* Refills:*2*
2. Doxycycline Hyclate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO
Q12H (every 12 hours) for 10-14 days: Please continue this
medication for at least the next 10 days. At that time, your
physicians can help you decide what kind of further treatment
you need.
Disp:*28 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*
3. Outpatient Lab Work
Please check patient's CBC and differential.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital with a very low white blood
cell count and fevers.  You also had an elevated potassium level
and decreased kidney function.  You were initially admitted to
the ICU for monitoring.  Your potassium level and kidney
function quickly improved with IV fluids.  It was thought that
bactrim led to your low white blood cell count and possibly your
fever.  The infection in your left armpit also may have led to
your fever.  You were started on two strong antibiotics,
Vancomycin and Cefepime, and were then transferred out of the
ICU to the medicine floor.

While on the medicine floor your white blood count began to
improve, and your fevers stopped. You were transitioned to an
oral antibiotic, doxycycline, which will need to be taken for at
least the next 10 days. No other changes were made to your home
medications.

Followup Instructions:
We would like to have you seen at least once a week for the next
several weeks to continue to monitor your infection.

We would recommend that you follow-up with your primary care
physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 41875**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] within the next three days to have
your CBC checked and your axillary infection monitored.

You will also have follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]  [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13895**], your
infectious disease physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) 357**] call his office at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**] for this appointment time. This appointment will
likely be within the next 2 weeks at which time your infection
can be further monitored and your CBC can again be checked.

Please continue your doxycycline for at least the next 10 days.
If your infection improves on this medication alone, your
infection will have been treated. If your infection persists or
worsens, you may need further antibiotic and/or surgical
treatment of your abscess.

Brief Hospital Course:

# Bacteremia/Abscesses/Antibiotic therapy

Unfortunately side effects necessitated further antibiotic
adjustment. CBC with noted leukopenia on [**8-5**] with progression
to neutropenia [**8-8**].  Out of concern that vancomycin could be
contributing to decreasing counts, vanc d/c'ed  and IV
daptomycin started. Per ID will plan to treat MSSA
bacteremia/abscesses with IV daptomycin to total of 6-8wk
course. At time of discharge utility of repeat imaging
discussed. Plan to repeat CT abd/pelvis; MRI spine further into
antibiotic treatment.

# Blood Pressure

During MICU stay pt had repeated episodes of transient
bradycardia and hypotension as well as episodes of paroxysmal
hypertension into the SBP 180-200s. Her hypertension responded
to 5mg-10mg doses of IV labetalol. After significiant diuresis,
her SBP remained stable in the 150-160s. On the floor, BP ran
consistently high. Patient was started on metoprolol and
amlodipine. These medications were gradually uptitrated and at
time of discharge pressures were better controlled on metoprolol
50mg TID, amlopidine 10mg QD. She was transitioned to toprol xl
150mg daily at the time of discharge.

# Nutrition

Patient underwent severeal video swallowing evaluation due to
concern for silent aspiration. In the MICU, several methods of
nutrition employed: NG tube feeds as well as PPN. On transfer to
floor patient on NG tube feeds. Repeat speech and swallow on
[**8-15**] demonstrated improved oral and pharyngeal swallow with
continued swallow delay, premature spillover and reduced base of
tongue retraction. Patient continued to aspirate thin liquids
silently, but speech deemed it safe to initiate a PO diet of
nectar thick liquids and moist, ground solids with the
aspiration precautions documented below. It is important to note
aspiration is silent,
and she will need continued speech therapy follow up with likely
repeat video swallow before advancing her diet.

Discharge Instructions:

You were initially admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to symptoms of back
pain. Upon imaging it was found that you had several abscesses
throughout your spine as well as in your right knee. You
underwent several surgeries to evacuate these infection and you
were also started on antibiotics. Your antibiotic regimen was
altered several times due to significant side effects. You
experienced a rash after Nafcillin, and Vancomyocin was thought
to contribute to low cell counts. You were placed on Daptomycin
without side effect for a planned 8week course. A PICC line was
placed prior to discharge to faciliate antibiotic administration
as an outpatient. You will receive repeat imaging after
completion of your antibiotic therapy for interval evaluation of
infection.

We also found your blood pressures to be elevated at times
during your hospitalization. You were started on medications,
metoprolol and amlodipine, to better control your blood
pressure.
.
Regarding nutrition, after extubation you were noted to have
difficultly swallowing. Speech and swallow was consulted and
after several attempts you completed and passed your evaluation.
After completion, you were started on a thickened nectar liquid
regimen and a soft, ground solid diet. You will need repeat
speech and swallow evaluation at rehab.

MEDICATIONS WE STARTED

--To treat your infection we STARTED Daptomycin 600mg IV Q24
(start date: [**2135-7-26**], stop date: [**2135-9-19**] (total 8 weeks))

--To treat PAIN we STARTED:
 1. FENTANYL 25 mcg/hr Patch, which can be reapplied every 72
hr;
 2. Two LIDOCAINE 5 %(700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patchs, Apply each
Adhesive Patch daily to back
 3. ACETAMINOPHEN 325 mg Tablet; you can take 1-2 tablets by
mouth every 6 hours.

--To treat your high blood pressure we started:
 1. AMLODIPINE 10mg daily; you will take two 5mg tablets daily
 2. Metoprolol succinate (toprol XL) 150mg tablet daily

-- To prevent blood clot formation while you heal and are
relatively limited in your movement you will continue to
receive: Heparin (Porcine)  5,000 unit/mL Solution  Injections
three times a day

--To help treat your anxiety we started:
1. Lorazepam  0.5 mg Tablet, you can take one 0.5 tablet by
mouth at at bedtime as needed for anxiety.

You will need Outpatient Lab Work which your facility can obtain
and fax to [**Hospital **] clinic

Brief Hospital Course:

Dr [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old man with systolic and diastolic heart
failure, hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, presenting with
altered mental status and volume overload.

# Altered mental status: On presentation, patient noted to be
profoundly somnolent and minimally responsive. Broad
differential diagnosis in this elderly gentleman. Arterial blood
gas revealed hypercarbia, and metabolic investigation revealed
hypothyroidism. Patient [**Hospital **] transferred to MICU for potential
initiation of non invasive positive pressure ventilation,
however hypercarbia began to resolve with initiation of thyroid
hormone and with stimuli.
Infectious workup was unrevealing with exception of concern for
early pneumonia superimposed on pulmonary edema. Overall
impression was that this was due to hypothyroidism in setting of
poor reserve secondary to congestive heart failure and volume
overload as well as hypercapnia with possible central
hypoventilation.

Neurology team was consulted to help in evaluation of altered
mental status, comprehensive workup including MRI of the brain
was obtained and they did not feel this was due to a primary CNS
disorder.

# Acute Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure Exacerbation:
Patient with gross volume overload on admission, with mild
hypoxia and relative bradycardia. [**Name2 (NI) **] evidence of myocardial
injury found on serial cardiac enzymes. Echocardiogram obtained
revealing severely depressed ejection fraction when compared to
prior from [**2127-4-1**], with global pattern suggestive of
metabolic process. Heart failure team consulted in ICU, and
confirmed above impression. Given patients hypothyroidism and
decompensated state, did not start beta blocker therapy. Given
hypertrophied left ventricle and very small ventricular size,
did not initiate intravenous diuretics to avoid abrupt reduction
in preload and cardiac output.

# Coronary Artery Disease / Angina: On presentation, patient had
been noted to have severe episodes of angina. Patient ruled out
for myocardial infarction by serial cardiac enzymes and did not
have new ECG changes noted. Patient likely suffering from demand
ischemia in setting of decompensated CHF. As clinical condition
improved, patient has remained angina free, even when
transferring to and from bed. Echocardiogram and ECG suggestive
of prior inferior myocardial event. Once stable, would consider
initiation of statin therapy for secondary prevention. Would
continue daily Aspirin 81mg.

# Atrial fibrillation: Patient has recently diagnosed atrial
fibrillation with good rate control although he is not being
treated with any nodal agents. Given severely depressed systolic
function, would not initiate any calcium channel blockers, and
for the acute exacerbation period would continue to hold off on
beta blocker therapy as rate permits. This was discussed with
inpatient cardiologist (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 437**]) and outpatient cardiologist
(Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name 73**]). Lastly, in spite of very high risk of
thromboembolic complications, and discussing thoroughly with
family, we continued to hold anticoagulation but maintained
aspirin therapy.

Discharge Condition:

Mental Status: Confused - sometimes
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or
wheelchair

Discharge Instructions:

You were hospitalized for worsening of your heart failure and
altered mental status. During your admission, we found your
thyroid hormone levels to be low. We resumed levothyroxine
supplementation and monitored you as your condition improved.

My nephew suffered a cardiac problem. The doctors are telling us he had prolonged down time. They are in the process of evaluating his brain function. EEG showed almost constant seizure activity, which they are managing with medications. I thought after 6 minutes without oxygen, your organs would shut down.

History of Present Illness:

Mr. [**Known lastname 86160**] is a 62 yo man with a hx of seizures, Lupus
anticoagulant on coumadin and hypertensive left CVA in [**2194**] with
minimal residual right sided symptoms who presents following a
prolonged generalized seizure this evening.  According to the
patinet's fiancee, 9:50 in the evening, the patient called to
her
and stating he could feel a seizure coming on.  She found him in
the living room with his head turned to the right, and his right
arm moving briskly and rhythmically.  His eyes where blinking.
This lasted approximately 3 minutes then tapered only to
restart.

Brief Hospital Course:

Initially, the patient was started on Keppra and admitted to our
ICU. He was extubated after two days and sedation was stopped
with improvement of level of arousal. Arousal impaired initially
by sedation then likely by post-ictal state and clearing
sedation, without evidence of further seziure on EEG.

Given the initial concern for an infectious etiology (7 WBC in
CSF tube 4, 1RBC), the patient was started initially on
acyclovir, vancomycin and ceftriaxone, which were stopped two
(vanc) and four (CTX/acyclovir) days later after HSV PCR was
negative and CSF culture showed no growth.

The patient's INR increased from 2.7 to 4, and ceftriaxone was
identified as the most likely cause of this increase. We also
noted the inelegant combination of carbamazampine (Tegretol)
with coumadin, but did not want to also change this without
participation of the patient's primary Neurologist, with whom he
will follow up in the week following discharge.

MRI showed leukomalacia and post-stroke changes including some
contrast blush at the old lesion. No evidence of gross
pathological process underlying seizures or any acute/recent
changes. MRI C-spine was unremarkable other than C56
degenerative disease and mild ventral cord impingement.

He was transferred to the floor, where he arrived afebrile, HDS,
and with normal mental status. He has some residual mild speech
dysarthria/slurring, which is apparently his baseline. He also
has some mild residual baseline right-sided proximal weakness
and bilateral lower-extremity neuropathic sensory loss.

Discharge Instructions:

You were treated for a generalized seizure that would not stop
on its own (a condition called status epilepticus). You will
continue to take carbamazepine 400mg twice daily, and now you
will take levetiracetam (Keppra) 1000mg twice daily to prevent
seizures. You will be following up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37041**] [**Name (STitle) 766**],
who will adjust your medications as needed. If you need to
change this appointment, please call his office ASAP. It may be
good if he could switch you to a different medication so he can
take you off the carbamazepime (Tegretol), which has an
unfavorable interaction with warfarin (Coumadin).

You MUST have your INR monitored and take warfarin or another
medication for anticoagulation. It is not safe (clotting risk,
can have life-threatening PE or death) for you not to take the
medication, and it is also not safe for you to take the
medication without monitoring and dose adjustments (bleeding
risk, can have life-threatening GI or brain bleed or death). You
need to re-initiate monitoring. Please follow this up with your
PCP or begin using your home monitoring unit starting today.

While in icu we were told that he got a blood infection and started getting treated wiith antibodics immedicately. Since then he was totally disoriented, breathing rapidly, could not stay woke for long periods of time, it was scary. Doctors told us that there was not much more they could do for my dad. He also had blood in his urnine from the time hes been in icu. He is out of icu, sent on the cardaic floor, now on the kidney floor. On th kidney floor he was seeing things that were not there and talking about things from the past and things that did not make since.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital and found to have a bacterial
infection in your blood related to your hemodialysis cathether.
You required aggressive fluid resuscitation in the intesive care
unit and intravenous antibiotics.  Your hemodialysis catheter
had to be pulled out and a new one was put in after your
cultures were clear for 72 hours and your fevers went down.  You
had difficulty breathing due to the large volume of fluid
required to keep your blood pressure up.   Your breathing
improved once we were able to restart your dialysis.  You were
also found to have a urinary tract infection which was treated
with antibiotics.

Your platelets were low on admission but improved to normal
during this hospital stay.

Your atrial fibrillation was adequately rate controlled during
this admission.  We recommend that you discuss starting
anti-coagulation for your atrial fibrillation with your primary
care doctor.

Please contact your doctor or go to the emergency room if you
have any of the following symptoms: fevers or chills, difficulty
breathing, redness or swelling around your catheter site or any
other concerning symtpoms.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital because you were found
unresponsive, without a pulse and not breathing outside the
hospital.  The EMS team performed CPR and they were able to get
your heart pumping again.  Your lab work and EKG showed that you
had a large heart attack.  You underwent a cardiac cath with
placement of a stent in your heart to open the artery and
restore blood flow.  You underwent cooling of your body in the
ICU to perserve your brain function while your heart had stopped
pumping blood to the brain.

You also were not breathing when the EMS team found you
alongside the road.  You had a tube inserted in your lungs and
you were ventilated by a machine in the ICU.  You had several
rib fractures from the CPR and developed a pneumothorax.  This
is when free air enters the chest and pushes the lungs out of
the way, collapsing the lungs.  You had a tube inserted through
your chest wall to let this air out so that the lungs could
re-expand.  While you were on the ventilator, you aspirated some
of your saliva and vomit, resulting in a pneumonia.  You
recieved antibiotics for this and your respiratory status has
improved.

Ultimately, you were in the ICU under sedation for a very long
time while your lungs were recovering.  You are ready for
discharge from the hospital now but you will still feel weak and
tired for some time.  You were paralyzed during part of this
recovery and your body is using many of its resources to heal.
This results in significant weakness and fatigue which can last
for several months but which will get better as your work with
physical therapy.

The following changes were made to your medications:
- CHANGE TO metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily for your heart
- STOP taking simvastatin, this has been replaced with another
med
- START taking atorvastatin (lipitor) 80 mg daily for your
cholesterol
- START taking aspirin 81 mg daily for your heart
- YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TAKING PLAVIX 75 MG DAILY, THIS IS TO KEEP
THE STENT IN YOUR HEART OPEN
- DECREASE lisinopril to 10 mg daily
- INCREASE INSULIN as directed by the sliding scale

You should keep all of the follow-up appointments listed below
so that we can ensure that you continue to improve.  You should
bring your medications to each appointment so your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **]
update their records and adjust the doses as needed.

Discharge Instructions:

It was a pleasure taking care of you! You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
for evaluation and treatment of nausea and vomiting and were
found to have a dangerously low heart rate from your diltiazem
as well as pneumonia. Your diltiazem medication was held, you
were monitored in the intensive care unit, given fluids and
antibiotics and your condition improved. You were evaluated
further on the floor and your condition continued to
progressively get better. You had a fast heart rate (not
dangerously fast) which was likely due to pneumonia,
deconditioning (being sick in the hospital), and withdrawal from
the diltiazem which is gradually improving.

You still have remaining issues with your blood pressure. You
blood pressure levels are higher than we would like but no
dangerously so. Given your significant troubles with your heart
rate we are referring you to see a cardiologist as an outpatient
to make some medication adjustments.

The following changes have been made to your medications:
-STOP Diltiazem (do not take this medication unless told to do
so by your primary care doctor or cardiologist)
-DECREASE your Novolog 70/30 to 15 units in the morning and 7
units at night, please monitor your blood sugars and keep track
of these measurements so that your primary care doctor can make
adjustments
-START Humalog (Insulin Aspart) prior to meals and at bedtime
according the the sliding scale provided
-START Azithromycin 250mg by mouth once daily for 2 more days
-START Chlorthalidone 50mg by mouth once daily
-START Tylenol 325-650mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for
pain (do not take more than 3 grams daily)
-START Dextromethorphan/Guaifenesin sugar free cough syrup 1
dose by mouth every 6 hours as needed for cough
-Continue taking your other home medications as directed

Brief Hospital Course:

24 yo obese young man presenting with hyperglycemia,
nausea/vomiting, and abdominal discomfort in the setting of
critically elevated blood sugar consistent with hyperosmolar
hyperglycemic state found to have new diagnosis of diabetes.

# Diabetes Mellitus: The patient had a history of glucose
intolerance and A1c was 6 in [**6-14**]. He complained of abd pain,
polydipsia, polyuria, leg cramps, and weight loss. Patient
presented with blood glucose of 846; anion gap was 19. Blood and
serum were negative for ketones and Sosm was 304. He had no
mental status changes. An infectious work-up was performed and
was negative. He was initially started on an insulin gtt in the
ICU and was eventually transitioned to subcutaneous insulin.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted.  A1c was 10.6. He was diagnosed with
diabetes and received diabetes and nutrition education.  Insulin
regimen was uptitrated throughout the admission.  GAD antibody
was pending at discharge.  He has outpatient [**Last Name (un) **] and PCP
follow up.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted for very high blood sugar and were diagnosed
with diabetes mellitus. This will require close follow-up until
your blood sugars are under reliable control. Diabetes is a
disease that puts you at risk for kidney disease, heart attack,
stroke, and eye disease and you will need to take excellent care
of yourself to avoid these complications.

We made the following changes to your medications:
We STARTED a baby aspirin per day (81 mg per day)
We STARTED insulin:
-take 50 units of 70/30 every morning
-take 60 units of 70/30 every evening
-take humalog per the sliding scale before each meal and before
bed time

It is important that you eat three regularly scheduled meals per
day.  If you are not going to eat one day because you are sick,
you need to call [**Last Name (un) **] to ask them how much insulin you should
administer.

You will need to follow-up with your primary care doctor to
discuss possible treatment of your high blood pressure and
cholesterol levels.

Discharge Instructions:

Please continue to take the same medications you were on before
coming to the hospital.  You were admitted after fainting which
we think was a "vagal" reaction to your nausea/vomiting.  You
did not have a heart attack, you did not have a serious
arrhythmia when we interrogated your pacemaker, your
ecchocardiogram was improved from last month, CT of your
abdomen, head and neck were normal.

There were some changes on your EKG that were similar to the
changes found on stress test in [**Month (only) **].  You should follow up
with your PCP and or cardiologist about this; they may suggest a
repeat stress test, but not necessarily.

You also have low iron levels causing anemia.  You should
discuss this with your PCP and possibly [**Name Initial (PRE) **] gastroenterologist to
evalute GI causes of bleeding.

If you have any chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath,
light headedness, or fainting you should seek immediate medical
attention.

Please follow up with your PCP and cardiologist within the next
week.

Brief Hospital Course:

Mrs [**Known lastname 33419**] was admitted on [**2153-10-6**] after sustaining an
unwitnessed fall.
A CT head was performed on arrival and showed: 1. Left frontal
and posterior right parietal foci of acute subarachnoid
hemorrhage. Small amount of acute intraventricular hemorrhage in
the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. 2. Subdural
hematoma along the falx.
CT torso demonstrated rupture of large intrahepatic ?cystic
structure with hemorrhage and hemoperitoneum. No active
extravasation seen; fracture of the sternal body. Nondisplaced
lateral right 4th-7th and left 5th rib fractures. No
pneumothorax.
She was admitted to the TICU overnight and closely monitored.
She remained hemodynamically stable and her Hct was stable
around 30.

Discharge Condition:

Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker
or cane).

Discharge Instructions:

* You were admitted to the hospital after falling with multiple
injuries including broken ribs, bruising in your brain and blood
in your abdomen due to a ruptured liver cyst.  You are slowly
getting better but will need to continue to eat well and
increase your mobility to stay strong.

* You blood count has been stable which tells us that the
bleedng in your abdomen and bruising on your brain has also
stabelized.

* Your injury caused bilateral rib fractures which can cause
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths
because of the pain.

*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay
ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep
breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the
dose and notify your physician.

*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that
pool in the lungs.

*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to
hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing
and deep breathing.

*  Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short
periods may ease the pain.

*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid
and fiber intake if possible.

*  Do NOT smoke

*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation
around your ribs ( crepitus ). If you have any other new
symptoms that concern you please call your doctor or return to
the Emergency Room.

Discharge Instructions:

Mr. [**Known lastname **] you presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2180-3-29**] in severe
respiratory distress due to pneumonia illness.  This illness
required an admission to the medical intensive care unit and for
you to be intubated and placed on a respirator. During this time
you were diagnosed with pneumonia due to legionella infection
and were begun on Levofloxacin IV antibiotics. However, during
this time you stopped making urine and required dialysis. Your
ICU course was complicated by an arrhythmia called atrial
flutter/fibrillation. You were started on warfarin
anticoagulation therapy to minimize your risk of stroke. This
will require following INR on a regular basis.  You also had an
episode where your heart stopped (lost pulse) and you required
rescusitation, which was successful.

You improved on antibiotics and were transfered to the medical
floor where your respiratory status improved and you defervesed.
You were continued on dialysis 3x per week.  You also
demonstrated significant weakness likely due to the long
admission in the intensive care unit. However your strength
improved somewhat during your stay.

Your renal failure requires hemodialysis at this time. You will
need to copntinue hemodialysis as an outpatient with a renal
physician following your care.

We have made the following changes to your medication regimen:
- STOP TAKING atenolol while using the diltiazem.
- STOP TAKING minitran patch while using the diltiazem.
- STOP TAKING furosemide until/unless instructed to resume by
your doctors.
- STOP TAKING sodium bicarbonate until/unless instructed to
resume by your doctors.
- BEGIN TAKING diltiazem 30 mg PO every 6 hours for heart rate
control (your doctor may wish to change you to a once-daily
formula once you are stable on this regimen)
- BEGIN TAKING warfarin 2.5 mg PO daily (your doctor will need
to monitor your INR and may need to adjust your dose)
- BEGIN TAKING Phos-Lo to control your phosphate levels (total 4
tablets daily or as directed by your nephrologist)
- BEGIN TAKING aspirin 81 mg PO daily
- TAKE AS NEEDED acetaminophen for fever or pain
- COMPLETE COURSE of levofloxacin (antibiotic) for your
pneumonia (3 more doses over 6 days)

Please continue to take your medications as prescribed.

Followup Instructions:

Please have make an appointment with your primary care physician
on discharge from rehab. You should review your medications with
your doctor and discuss referral to a cardiologist for your
atrial fibrillation. You will also need to have your INR
monitored regularly while on anticoagulation therapy with
warfarin.

You will need to follow up with a nephrologist at discharge from
rehab (either your prior nephrologist or a new provider) to
monitor your kidney function and need for dialysis.

Brief Hospital Course:

This is an 86 year-old female with history of atrial
fibrillation and sick sinus syndrome with pacemaker who
presented with ST elevation inferior myocardial infarction after
a elective pacemaker generator change.

1. STEMI: Her pacemaker generator was changed, and as she was
leaving to go home, she had severe bandlike chest pressure.  An
electrocardiogram was consistent with an inferior myocardial
infarction.  At the [**Hospital1 18**], she underwent cardiac catherization
that showed a 100% lesion in the proximal right coronary artery.
 Two stents were placed to the proximal right coronary with good
resultant flow.  She did have bleeding and developed a small
hematoma as the right arterial sheath was pulled.  Her
hematocrit remained stable.  A post-procedure electrogram had no
residual ST elevations or depressions.  A swan-ganz catheter was
left in her right groin access post procedure for hemodynamic
monitoring since her lesion was in the proximal right coronary
and since there was concern for right ventricular involvement.
There was a single vessel, however, that had its origin prior to
the stenosed lesion.  An echocardiogram, on hospital day 2,
showed an ejection fraction of 50% with left ventricular
inferior basal hypokinesis.  There was normal right ventricular
systolic function with a question of inferior hypokinesis.  Post
procedure, her cardiac output fell and nadired at 1.9 (index =
1.1) with decreased urine output.  The decrease in cardiac
output was attributed to a combination of possible right
ventricular involvement and tachycardia to the 140s.  Both IV
and oral metoprolol were given in attempt to control her rate;
however, she was not able to maintain her pressure with the beta
blockade.  She was started on dobutamine (2.5 mcg/kg/min), and
her cardiac output increased to 3.4 (index = 2.13).  Her urine
output also improved.  She was initially maintained on aspirin,
Plavix, high dose Statin, and metoprolol.  She did not receive
Integrilin as she received Lovenox prior to transfer to the
[**Hospital1 18**] and then received heparin during catherization.  Within 24
hours, she was weaned from the dobutamine.  An ACE-inhibitor was
started and titrated as her blood pressure allowed.  She had no
further episodes of chest pain.  She will need 12 months of
Plavix for her stents.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: She initially was tachycardic to the
140s.  Her rate decreased to the 120s with IV and oral
metoprolol.  She did have a drop in her blood pressure with the
metoprolol.  As her blood pressure improved, she was started on
diltiazem, which was titrated up to her home dose.  She was
subsequently transitioned back to her outpatient regimen of
atenolol and diltiazem XL.  She remained rate controlled in the
80s.  Her Coumadin dose of 2.5 mg was restarted on hospital day
2.  She was bridged with Lovenox.  Since she is on aspirin,
Plavix, and Coumadin, her goal INR should be 1.8-2.0.  At the
time of discharge, her INR was 1.3.  She was discharged with 2
days of Lovenox.

3. Sick Sinus Syndrome: Her pacemaker generator was changed the
day of admission and she had no complications.

4. FEN: Cardiac diet.

5. Prophylaxis: Coumadin with Lovenox bridge, bowel regimen,
PPI.

6. Access: Her left venous sheath was maintained for 24 hours
while she had her swan-ganz in place.  She also had peripheral
IVs.

7. Dispo: She was discharged to home on hospital day 5 after she
had 3 sessions with physical therapy to restore her functional
mobility back to her baseline.

Discharge Condition:

Stable.  She had no further chest pain.  Her heart rate was well
controlled.

Discharge Instructions:

Take all medications as prescribed.

Seek medical attention if you have any chest pain, shortness of
breath, nausea, vomiting, light-headedness or anything else that
you find worrisome.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight &gt; 3 lbs.

Followup Instructions:

You should follow-up with your primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-26**]
weeks.  You should follow-up with your cardiologist in [**1-26**]
weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:

# Altered Mental Status: The patient was initially brought in to
be evaluated for possible confusion per his family. However on
further questioning, he initially appeared to be at his relative
[**Year (4 digits) 5348**] ([**Name2 (NI) 11345**], nearly deaf, left hemiplegia, intermittently
saying [**1-14**] words with signficant stimulation but rarely
oriented). An RPR was found to be mildy positive and
neurosyphyllis was thought to be possibly contributing to his
confusion. To this end a lumbar puncture under fluoroscopic
guidance was pursued. However, due to decompensation (see below)
the LP was not completed. Given the risk of a repeat LP, under
guidance from the infectious disease department, it was decided
to treat him for presumed neurosyphyllis. He received 2 weeks of
IV ceftriaxone, completed in house, with little improvement of
his mental status after his arrest. After his arrest, the
patients mental status became essentially unresponsive to any
stimuli. Repeat CT head and EEG showed no acute process. The
patient could not receive an MRI due to a pacemaker. In
consultation with neurology, his new [**Month/Day (2) 5348**] may be a result of
some anoxic brain injury.

# PEA arrest: The morning of his lumbar puncture, a CXR showed
complete opacification of his right lung, likely indicating a
significant mucous plug at that time. At [**Month/Day (2) 5348**], he has a
large, chronic, loculated pleural effusion that compresses most
of the right lung, leaving only a small section aerated. During
his lumbar puncture procedure, the patient suffered a PEA arrest
and was down for approximately 5 minutes. He was resuscitated
with CPR. As above, after the arrest, his mental status was
essentially unresponsive. His ability to protect his airway was
significantly decreased. After initial extubation after his
arrest, he required frequent nasal trumpet suctioning to prevent
recurrent mucous plugging. Even with frequent suctioning, he had
several further mucous plugging events with significant
desaturations requiring acute suction. The last such event was a
near respiratory arrest on the general medical floor requiring
re-intubation. After lengthy discussion with his family, it was
decided to place a tracheostomy to attempt to minimize further
mucous plugging events and ease suctioning, as he was having
significant nasopharyngeal trauma from NT suctioning. Hyocamine
tabs and mucomyst nebs were added to decrease and help clear
secretions. He will require frequent suctioning and close
monitoring of his airway to minimize further plugging events.
The family was made aware that the tracheostomy may not prevent
further events and that his overall mortality in the next year
is significant. They feel strongly that the patient would want
to continue living no matter what the cost. Extensive
discussions were held regarding goals of care and code status
with no change in his full code status. The family's overall
goal is to bring the patient home if at all possible.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital because you were confused, and
had also been having some vomiting, and bleeding from your
fistula. You were found to have an infection of your urine which
was treated with antibiotics. In the setting of working up your
confusion, a lumbar puncture was attempted. During this you had
low oxygen levels and your heart stopped. This was likely due to
mucous plugging. To attempt to prevent further plugging events,
a tracheostomy was performed. Your fistula was also surgically
repaired and a tunnelled dialysis catheter was placed in your
groin.

My friend (62 yrs female) was admitted to hospital in January with BOOP. she was found to have 2 bacterial cases of pneumonia and one viral. She had respiratory failure and was in the ICU unite for 14 days under induced coma. She went for a check up with the consultant today and he has prescribed Septrin tablets to be taken 3 times weekly. does this mean she is still infected? Also, as my friend lives with me and came out of hospital on 1st February I presumed she was clear. However, I visited my mother on 28th February for a week and after 2 weeks she informed me that she has bronchial pneumonia. Could I have been the carrier?Thank you.

Discharge Instructions:

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in the
hospital.  You were admitted for evaluation and treatment of
your rash, which was felt to be an allergic reaction to
antibiotics.  We are not sure which antibiotic caused this as
you were exposed to several including:  Vancomycin, zosyn,
meropenem and azithromycin.  The most likely cause was zosyn
however.  You will need to have allergy testing in the next few
months to determine which antibiotics are safe for you to take.
Your skin was biopsied and confirmed a drug reaction called
acute generalized errythematous pustulosis or AGEP.  This rash
improved with topical creams and systemic steroids.

You were also transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] with concern for a
pneumonia.  You recieved antibiotics at the outside hospital
that may have contributed to the worsening of your rash and upon
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] these were changed and you continued to be
treated for a bacterial pneumonia.  Despite antibiotics your
breathing and oxygenation actually got worse and you were seen
by our pulmonologists who felt that your rash and breathing
could have been caused by a severe case of chicken pox, you were
treated for this but ultimately this was not felt to be the
cause of your sypmtoms.  A CT scan of your chest showed a large
amount of inflammation in your lungs that despite steroids and
antibiotics got worse on a repeat scan two days later.  You were
brought to the ICU for a procedure called a bronchoscopy and
cultures were sent from this material which were negative.  As
it was not clear to any of the doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 40087**] for [**Name5 (PTitle) **] whether
you had an infection or an allergic reaction in your lungs a
lung biopsy was preformed.  You tolerated the procedure well,
but were slow to wake up so you were sent to the ICU for
monitoring overnight.  The biopsy results were unexpected.  It
appears that part of your lung was affected by a chronic
condition called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia while other
parts of your lung were affected by more acute inflammation.
You likely developed the chronic condition prior to your
hospitalization in early [**Month (only) 1096**] and during this most reccent
hospitalization had acute inflammation from a viral infection.
Both of these processes are treated with steroids and you
improved greatly with steroids while in the hospital.  You were
discharged on steroids and will follow up with our
pulmonologists in a few weeks to determine the course of
treatment.  You should continue to quit smoking and avoid any
contact with smokers while your lungs heal.

Discharge Instructions:

You were hospitalized for a rectal mass causing partial
obstruction of your colon. You also had an infection of your
colon called clostridium difficile. You were seen by the GI and
Surgery services and were treated with antibiotics with
improvement in your colon infection. You were also felt to have
obstruction from your rectal mass and a colonic stent was placed
by the gastroenterology team. You were able to move your bowels
following the procedure and tolerated the procedure well.

Since your colon was inflamed and the stent can only partially
relieve an obstruction, it is very important that you keep to a
diet of soft low residue foods to prevent pain, perforation, and
recurrent obstruction.

It is very important that you call your doctor if you experience
any fevers, chills, severe abdominal pain, or experience an
inability to move your bowels or pass gas from below, or if you
have severe nausea and vomiting.

You will need to discuss with your Oncologist and your [**Location (un) 3390**] how
to continue to maximize your nutritional status and should also
have them monitor your blood counts.

Medication changes:

1.start Oral vancomycin 125mg four times a day through [**2149-12-26**].
2.start omeprazole for stomach irritation. Please discuss with
your GI doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3390**] if you will need to continue this
medication.

Brief Hospital Course:

1) pneumonia complicated by sepsis: patient was seen in the ED
and a "code sepsis" was called based on fever, tachycardia, and
a lactate of 4.4. She had a chest x ray demonstrating a right
middle lobe pneumonia. She had transient hypotension and was on
Levophed. She was admitted to the MICU and placed on ceftriaxone
and azithromycin. She had received a dose of levofloxacin in the
ED, but this was stopped due to potential reaction with
myasthenia. Her Levophed was quickly weaned off and she was
quickly hemodynamically stable. She remained on O2, but this was
also stopped after a couple of days. Her NIFs and vital
capacities were monitored to ensure no myasthenic crisis. These
remained stable. She was called out to the floor and did well.
Her d/c NIF was -22 and vital capacity was -1100. She was
discharged home and will complete a course of cefpodoxime and
azithromycin. She will follow her respiratory status as
azithromycin can also provoke a myasthenic crisis. She was also
given a dose of Pneumovax prior to her discharge. No organism
was identified as the etiology of her pneumonia.

2) myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]: patient was maintained on prednisone and
Mestinon at her home doses. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and neurology followed
her initially. She did well and had no complications from her
myasthenia. She will be followed as an outpatient. She was
started on Bactrim for pneumocystis prophylaxis given her
chronic steroid use.

She went to the hospital 10 days ago for bad pain and trouble urinatitng. I talked her friday after she had her lung drained. They had to drain inection from her colon and then said she had phenmonia. I left her in ICU at around 7:00pm that friday and she was talking, when I got to the hospital that saturday morning around 9:00 am I couldnt even wake her up. They said they gave her some oxycodone because she was restless and they have her on morhine. They said that when they drained her lung they found cancer cells. Could the cancer have spread that quick and why was I just talking to her and now she is gone. She was like a vegetable when I got there and could not talk after that and could not see. we couldnt even close her eyes when she died. Something just does not seem right to me

Brief Hospital Course:

A/P 66 y.o. with ESRD on HD with markedly elevated WBC and
hypotension of unclear etiology.

# hypotension: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] presented with persistent hypotension
of unclear source. She was not previuosly dialyzed.  Sepsis was
considered from HD line or intraabdominal process. Pancytopenia
in presence of leukocytosis concerning for hematologic
malignancy. She had daily blood cultures, none of which grew
anything by the time of this summary. Cultures from the OSH did
not grow anything. Her diltiazem was held. She required 2
pressors, and was still somewhat hypotensive. She was treated
with vanco, levo, flagyl for a possible line infection. Renal
was consulted and it was decided not to pull her HD line in case
she needed dialysis. CT of the abdomen showed a large mass in
the right lobe of her liver, with possible peritoneal and lymph
node involvement. Over the course of her short stay her blood
pressure remained low. He son [**Name (NI) **] was consulted and she was
made DNR/DNI. He flew up from [**State **] to see her and to talk
with his family about CMO. Shortly after his arrival Mrs. [**Known lastname **]
died of cardiac arrest.

# hepatic mucinous adenocarcinoma: Hematology/oncology was
consulted, and felt that she had incurable disease with a grim
prognosis. In her condition on admission there was no possible
treatment option. LFTs were followed and were elevated
throughout, particularly AST and Alk Phos. Her pain was
controlled on her home regimen of oxycodone.

# Dispo: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] died Monday [**10-14**] at 9PM of cardiac
arrest, thought to be secondary to her malignancy. An autopsy
was declined by her family.

        <note_excerpt>
CT TORSO WITH ANGIOGRAM ([**2181-9-4**]):

1. Embolic occlusion of the segmental artery supplying the
posterior segment
of the left upper lobe.
2. No evidence of central PE.
3. Pulsation artifacts in both the left and right lower lobe
segmental
arteries, small emboli in the left dorsal segmental arteries can
therefore not
be excluded.
4. No evidence of right cardiac abnormalities.
5. No evidence of substantial lung parenchymal damage.
LOWER EXTREMITY NON-INVASIVE IMAGING ([**2181-9-5**]):
There is no ultrasound evidence of deep venous thrombosis in
relation to either lower limb.

Brief Hospital Course:

PULM: Obstructive Sleep Apnea
At the time of arrival, the patient was intubated.  He was
successfully extubated within 24 hours. In addition to episodes
of apnea and tachycardia, nocturnal oxygen saturations were
thereafter noted to decrease into the 70s.  Sleep Medicine study
findings were consistent with the presence of at least mild
sleep disordered breathing. CPAP therapy was initiated in the
hospital.  The patient tolerated the CPAP well, and continuous
monitoring demonstrated oxygen saturations consistently above
91% overnight.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] after experiencing a prolonged
seizure.

You were monitored very closely in the intensive care unit, and
then on the [**Hospital1 **], with continuous epilepsy recording.  Your
seizures seemed to become better controlled with an increase in
the lamictal.

Despite empiric antibiotics, you developed intermittent fevers
early in the hospital course.  Blood and urine cultures have
been negative to date.  Chest x-rays were negative.  An x-ray of
the right middle finger demonstrated no signs of osteomyelitis.
CT scans of the chest and abdomen failed to suggest "hidden"
sources of infection, including those related to the implanted
devices.  Becuase you developed shortness of breath in the
context of fever and immobility, a CT Angiogram was also
performed; the study did show a small blood clot in one of the
vessels serving your lungs.  However, there were no blood clots
found in the deep veins of your legs.  "Blood thinners" lovenox
and coumadin were started to address the lung clot.  Within 24
hours of starting treatment your fevers resolved.  Our
colleagues on the medicine team suggested the anticoagulation
treatment be continued for as long as six months.  If the
coumadin dosing becomes difficult to modify due to interaction
with the anti-epileptic medicines, the treatment could be
shortnened to three months.  It will be important to work with
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 15532**] to monitor the INR (goal range 2-3) and make
necessary adjustments.

* Please take all of your medication as prescribed.  Please note
that the LAMICTAL has been INCREASED.  In one week,[**2181-9-14**],
please increase the dose of lamictal to 250 mg by mouth twice
daily.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will make any necessary further adjustments.

* Please attend all follow-up appoitnments.

* It will be important to have the INR value checked anytime on
Saturday [**2181-9-8**] at the [**Hospital 3175**] Hospital Lab in [**Location (un) 94757**] (a
requisition has been faxed).  Please WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM
THE DOCTOR ON CALL BEFORE TAKING YOUR NEXT DOSE OF THE COUMADIN.
 If you do not hear from the on-call doctor, please call Dr. [**Name (NI) 94758**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94759**] and ask to have the doctor on
call paged.

* It will be important to have the INR checked again on Monday
[**2181-9-10**] at Dr.[**Name (NI) 49335**] office at 10 am.

The target INR range is [**2-20**].  The lovenox injections should be
continued until the INR value is above 2 for at least 48 hours.
Thereafter, the lovenox can be stopped.  The coumadin should be
continued for 3-6 months.

Brief Hospital Course:

Active Issues:

# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient was noted to have a
creat of 5.4, baseline 3.5-4.0, and oliguria x 2-3 days on
admission. As stated above she had previously required
ultrafiltration during hospitalizations for heart failure
exacerbation.  Renal was consulted and felt that the patient
would require chronic HD.  Given her hypotension she was
initally started on CVVH with dopamine gtt for pressure support.
 However as above she did not tolerate CVVH and it was
discontinued.  She was diuresed with lasix gtt and milrinone as
above until she had her tunneled line placed on HD#6.  She
tolerated HD well, with stable BP and no muscle cramping.
Outpatient dialysis was arranged with [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] Dialysis
Center for mondays, wednesdays and fridays.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and
not making urine. Your heart was not pumping well which caused
you to have extra fluid.  We gave you medication to help you to
urinate out this fluid however your kidneys were not working
properly and you needed dialysis to do the job of your kidneys.
You got a special IV to be used for dialysis. You will need to
continue going to dialysis three times a week. Your blood
pressure was also so low so we did not give you your home blood
pressure medications while you were in the hospital.

You should continue to go to dialysis three times a week.  You
were also started on a medication called nephrocaps that you
will need to continue.

You should stop taking your carvedilol, metolazone,
spironolactone and lasix unless your doctor instructs you to
restart these medications.

Continue your coumadin and amiodarone for your abnormal heart
rhythm (atrial fibrillation).  Continue your aspirin and
pravastatin for your heart disease, your allopurinol for your
gout, your albuterol and ipratropium for your COPD.

My father died due to bleeding from upper GI tract while on hemodialysis . He had a hemodialysis about 3 days earlier- then he had a bleeding episode- a hemorrhage and then he was admitted to critical care unit. He was kept on medicines and then one more dialysis was conducted on him just 2 days before he died. After this dialysis, he was kept in the CCU only for two more days. On the third day he had breathing problems. He was given oxygen through a mask. After about 15 hours, the docs said he has to be put into mechanical ventilation support. He died in about 1 and a half hours time. Could you please let me know if this death was timely or was it caused by some wrong medicines during his dialysis.

History of Present Illness:

While at the OSH the pathology from the trans bronichial biopsy
was sent to another OSH, which was intepreted as consistent with
BOOP.  Serologic [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, RF negative.  In the ICU, an a-line
and left subclavian were placed.  Mild transaminitis resolved in
days.  The patient subsequently received solumederol 0.5gm for a
number of days, which did not improve bilateral infiltrates.  He
developed Azotemia with BUN of 200. The patient subsequently
underwent repeat CT scan that revealed evidence of large
bilateral effusions with worsening infiltrates. Vent settings
prior to transfer AC 550 x 25 10 PEEP 40% Fi02. Pt with
Klebsiella in sputum, has remained afebrile.  Steroids were
tapered in setting of azotemia.  Diuresis was then attempted in
setting of systolic CHF, EF 40%.  [**Last Name (LF) 110711**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] block [**2-10**]
beta-blockade, coag (-) staph from a-line (since discontinued)
was also noted during his course.

Brief Hospital Course:

# Acute Hypoxemic Respitatory Failure: The patient presented
from an OSH with vent setting of 10 PEEP, 40% Fi02.
Differential of failure included BOOP, CHF, ANCA-associated
vasculitis e.g. Goodpasture's syndrome, and ventilator
associated pneumonia.  There was no evidence of emphasematous
changes on recent imaging to suggest obstructive physiology.
Continued solumedrol with taper, received multiple days of
solumedrol at [**Hospital **] Hospital.  Treated Klebsiella sputum
with piperacillin-tazobactam initially, converted to cipro.  The
patient initially improved with this regimen, but decompensated
during his course, with a hypotensive episode that was likely
due to a gastrointestinal hemorrhage.  With serial chest films,
there was a question of development of an aspiration pneumonia,
with progressive focal consolidation in the right lung base.
The patient was covered broadly for aspiration pneumonia with
courses of vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl, for a 10 day
course.  Volume overload, likely due to left heart failure and
steroid therapy, was managed with continuous [**Last Name (un) **]-venous
hemodialysis.  The patient's respiratory failure stabilized
following these interventions, and he was able to tolerate
minimal ventilatory support.  However, full wean off the
ventilator failed due to profound weakness, likely from steroid
and ICU-induced myopathy.  The patient thus was scheduled to
undergo a tracheostomy which was placed and patient required
ongoing ventilator support. given the grim prognosis for all of
his medical issues he was made CMO in the hospital.

# GI bleed:  On [**2139-1-25**], the patient was noted to be
hypotensive, requiring pressor support with levophed, then
dopamine.  This was weaned quickly.  NG lavage brought back
coffee grounds, and guaiac was positive.  The patient then had
persistent BRBPR for several days.  He received many units of
packed red blood cells.  He also received fresh frozen plasma
and vasopressin.  Colonoscopy and EGD were deferred given tenous
clinical status.  With improvement in the patient's
thrombocytopenia, the GI bleed resolved.  Following transfer for
tracheostomy, the patient's GI bleed recurred and he underwent a
rigid scope by surgery; he was found to have ischemic colitis
but felt to be a poor operative candidate. A decision was made
not to do aggressive treatments/transfusions and ultimately he
was made CMO.

#. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: DDx includes prerenal
azotemia (poor forward flow, intravascular depletion),
intrinsic, post-renal. Although now with signs of fluid
overload, BUN of 200.  No signs of acidosis, hyperkalemia to
sugest urgent emergeny need for dialysis. Pt may require HD vs
CVVH given azotemia.  Patient was initially managed with IV
diuresis, which proved difficult in setting of GI bleed.
Following stabilization of GI bleed, the patient received
hemofiltration during CVVH, with some volume removed.  His
creatinine improved but then as the above issues deteriorated
his Creatinine worsened given the family and patients desire not
to do aggressive fluids/blood transfusions.

Brief Hospital Course:

# UGIB: variceal bleed, emergent endoscopy with banding in the
ICU. pt resuscitated with blood products (given at [**Hospital1 18**]: 4
prbcs, 2 plt, 1 FFP) to hct goal 28. given IV PPI and octreotide
drip for 48 hrs as well as 5 days of IV ceftriaxone. He was
stabilized and sent to the floor, though he continued to have
melena.  He was started on nadalol 20 [**Hospital1 **] after 48 hrs for
secondary prevention. He did not require emergent TIPS, but was
scheduled for rebanding on [**8-27**].

# Hypotension: related to UGIB. Supported with fluid and blood
products as above, currently resolved.

#. CAD and rheumatic heart disease: pt w/ hx of MI and CABG. ASA
and heparin were held due to GIB. He was given nitro prn for
chronic stable angina.  Troponins trended up most likely due to
demand ischemia given hypotension.  Echocardiogram showed
preserved LV function and minimal valvular dysfunction and mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. He was rate controlled
with Beta blocker. Cardiology was consulted for transplant
workup.

Discharge Instructions:

You were seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for an upper GI bleed.  You received an
upper endoscopy during which your bleeding esophageal varices
were banded.  You were stabilized on the floor.  You also
experienced injury to your heart while you were bleeding.  You
will need to follow up with cardiology.

You should return to the ED or call your primary care provider
if you experience blood in your vomit, black tarry stools,
abdominal pain, worsening swelling in your belly, confusion,
fever greater than 101.4 degrees F, or any other symptoms that
concern you.

How was tachycardia treated in ICU?

        <note_excerpt>
Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital after having a heart attack.
You had 2 drug eluting stents placed in your left anterior
descending (LAD) artery and an angioplasty of your diagonal
artery.

You should take Aspirin 325mg daily indefinitely. You should
take Plavix 75mg daily for a minimum of one year. These
medications have antiplatelet effects, which helps to prevent
blood clots from forming inside your stents. Do not stop either
of these medications unless instructed to do so by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**].
Stopping either of these medications early COULD result in a
blockage inside your stents and another heart attack.

If you have chest pain, take Nitroglycerin under your tongue as
directed. If the pain does not go away, call 911.

Since you had a heart attack you should switch your Simvastatin
to Atorvastatin 80mg (stronger cholesterol medication). You will
need your cholesterol and liver function tests repeated in 6
weeks.

You are starting a new medication called Metoprolol succinate,
this medication will help to take some of the work load off of
your heart. It will lower your heart rate and blood pressure as
well.

While you were in the hospital you were losing blood, no source
was identified of where the blood was coming from. You received
3 units of blood while you were here. Your blood counts are
stable at this time. We changed your omeprazole (prilosec) to
pantoprazole because it does not interfere with the clopidogrel.

During your hospitalization you had ventricular tachycardia
which can be a life threatening heart rhythm. You are going home
with a lifevest which is worn externally and will shock you if
you have this dangerous rhythm again.

While you were in the hospital you developed a fever. You were
started on antibiotics for a suspected pneumonia. You should
continue to take Azithromycin 500mg daily until Friday.

You are starting on a blood thinner called Coumadin to prevent a
clot from forming in your left ventricle. This medication
requires close monitoring and frequent blood draws. The [**Hospital 197**]
clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] will manage your Coumadin dosing and blood
draws.

Brief Hospital Course:

On [**11-4**]/2010Mr.[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room and
underwent an emergent Bentall Procedure (#29 mm [**Company 1543**]
Freestyle Porcine Aortic Valve/root and Replacement of aortic
hemi-arch with #30mm Gelweave sidearm graft with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**].
Circulatory arrest time=22 minutes, Cross clamp time=150
minutes, and Cardiopulmonary Bypass time=187 minutes. Please
refer to the operative report for further details. He tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU intubated
and sedated. He awoke neurologically intact but required
Precedex for extubation. POD#1 he was extubated without
difficulty. Postoperative confusion and agitation was treated
with Haldol and Zyprexa, all narcotics were discontinued. He
remained in the CVICU until his mental status improved. All
lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion.
Beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin/ and diuresis were initiated. POD#6
Mr.[**Known lastname **] went into postoperative rapid atrial fibrillation that
was treated with Amiodarone and increased Beta-blocker and
ultimately converted to normal sinus rhythm. [**11-11**] Psychiatry and
social work was consulted to evaluate postoperative confusion
with hallucinations. Recommendations appreciated. POD#7 he was
transferred to the sterp down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. The remainder of his postoperative course was
essentially uneventful. His mental status returned to baseline.
POD# 9 Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] cleared him for discharge to home with
Visiting Nurse services. All follow up appointments were
advised.

Discharge Instructions:

No driving for approximately one month and while taking
narcotics, will be discussed at follow up appointment with

Physical Exam:

VS on arrival to the floor: T 98.7, HR 93, BP 127/75, 100% trach
with BIPAP  [**4-6**] rate 31
General: trached on vent, sleeping, some contractures of upper
extremities
HEENT: missing several teeth in front both upper and lower;
cannot open mouth fully to see in while sleeping; no gross
blood; nml sclera
Lungs: CTA anteriorly (per surgery note: "tongue with 1.5 cm old
laceration, covered in granulation tissue and mucosa, just left
of midline")
Cardio: RR, II/VI SEM at USB B/L, no r/g
Abd: + BS, PEG; somewhat distended and firm though no rebound or
guarding, no fluid wave or HSM appreciated
Extremities: [**12-4**]+ [**Location (un) **] right slightly greater than left but
fairly symmetric, no erythema or TTP; arms somewhat contracted
though mobile; right PIV
Skin: no ecchymoses; no evidnece of trauma
Neuro: sleeping when seen, arousable to voice though falls back
asleep quickly; non-verbal at baseline per ED notes

Brief Hospital Course:

43yoM with anoxic brain injury, s/p PEG &amp; trach, after a PEA
arrest on the EP table in [**9-/2202**] (pt was undergoing VT
ablation); admitted with stable tongue laceration (1 week old)
from biting tongue, found to be bacteremic with MRSA.

#. TONGUE LACERATION: The laceration was covered with
granulation tissue, no purulence/erythema, and ENT (who was
consulted in the ED) thought no urgent intervention was
required. On talking to the patient??????s sister and mother further,
it seems that the patient??????s tongue biting occurred
intermittently for the week or two prior to admission, when he
was on medication ??????to bring down his K??????. He underwent CT neck
w/contrast to evaluate for an irritative focus (no abnormality
was seen).  He then bit off more tongue on [**11-25**], OMFS was
consulted, and pulled 2 loose teeth that were thought to be the
culprit.  Finally on [**11-28**] the pt underwent total teeth
extraction. He will need an out-pt appointment with ENT if
family elects to have tongue fixed for cosmetic purposes.

# MRSA Bacteremia:  High grade bacteremia with 6/6 bottles
positive on [**11-20**], negative cultures since then. The patient
will need a 4 week course of Vanc 1g q12h, ending on [**12-19**], and
will need Vanc level, BUN, Cr weekly until then. Additionally,
the patient will be treated with possible VAP with
Cefepime/Cipro (Day 1 = [**11-24**], 7 day course will end on [**12-12**]).
TEE did not show vegetations or involvement of [**Month/Year (2) 3941**]; per ID recs,
will keep cardiac hardware in place for now.

# Aspiration PNA:  Resolved. Sputum cx c/w aspiration pna, pt
noted to also have secretions and suspect high aspiration risk.
Sputum growing respiratory flora and GNR; however, this is not
uncommon in pts with a trach, so will d/c antibiotics given
admission CXR did not show infiltrates. On [**11-24**], concern for
aspiration pneumonia given fever, ?infiltrate on CXR. Continued

#. S/P ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY: CT head with stable reduction in
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation, unchanged from previous. EEG
results: abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and
disorganization of a low voltage background rhythm. This finding
is consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
Medications, toxic/metabolic, infection, and anoxia are common
causes. No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures
are seen during this recording. Patient continued with
trach/vent.

Brief Hospital Course:

# Pleural TB: The patient has presumed pleural tuberculosis, for
which she is currently being treated with multi-drug therapy.
The duration of this therapy will be at the discretion of the
infectious disease physicians at the [**Hospital1 **].  She will have
observed therapy until decided otherwise.  The patient had a
baseline ophthalmologic eye exam while in the hospital, which
was normal.  She will need to have her eye exam followed while
on the tuberculosis medications.  In addition, the patient will
need to have her liver function tests followed weekly.

# Fevers: The patient has had cyclical fevers since admission,
which have been trending down.  Her blood cultures have all been
negative to date.  Initially she was treated with levofloxacin
and Unasyn to cover for aspiration and community-acquired
pneumonia. Coverage was broadened to vanco/Zosyn on hospital day
3. After completing a week of antibiotics, she remained
persistently febrile. All culture data including pleural fluid,
blood, and urine was negative. ID was consulted. Antibiotics
were held. Sputum was sent for AFB x 3. HIV Antibody was
negative. Fever has improved since induction of TB therapy.

Discharge Instructions:

You were diagnosed with tuberculosis in your pleural space. You
are being treated with multiple medications. You were diagnosed
with an anemia which is likely due to your ongoing infection.
You will be transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital where you can
continue your recovery including getting your pain and
tuberculosis medications.

        <patient_narrative>
My friend is 55 yrs old. Basically healthy except for high blood pressure which he takes 50 mg Toprol. Just recently, we believe a blood vessle popped in his head. He suddenly had headaches,dizzy and was unable to speak. He was in intensive care where they did catscans which showed blood on the brain(back of) near the neck i believe. He is in no pain but gets confused at times. Drs put him on 2 different blood pressure meds(one listed above) and B6 to get rid of water. He had reaction to the 2nd BP med and stopped it  My question is this.will the blood dry up? Will he get the ability to speak and stop getting confused and dizzy? How long will that take? Will he be alright with this blood on the brain and what can we do to dry it up?

History of Present Illness:

55yo man with PMH significant for HTN presented with sudden
onset weakness and disorientation. He was in his USOH until the
day of admission, when he first noticed the left-sided weakness
while walking up the stairs. He had just finished putting salve
in his hair and was previously feeling fine. He then had slurred
speech, left facial droop, and the left-sided weakness. He
initially waited to see if it would pass, but his family noticed
and called EMS. He had been told that he had facial droop in the
past. Review of systems was significant for mild right sided
headache, no visual complaints, bladder/bowel incontinence,
chest pain, SOB, dizziness.

Notably, he presented to [**Hospital1 112**] 2 weeks prior to admission with
right hand numbness/tingling and was told that he had an old
stroke on CT. He was told he was hypertensive and was started on
Toprol [**Last Name (LF) 8864**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and another anti-hypertensive that his
girlfriend could not recall. He began taking the [**First Name3 (LF) **] and Toprol,
but not the second antihypertensive. He saw his PCP several days
prior to admission and his Toprol was increased to 50mg daily.

Brief Hospital Course:

Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 yo man with h/o HTN and possible old strokes
who presented with acute onset of left-sided weakness of the
face, arm, and leg, with no cortical signs such as language
comprehension deficits. Acute intracerebral hemorrhage of the
right midbrain/pons/cerebral peduncle was seen on CT, without
corresponding vascular anomalies on CTA. This is a relatively
classic location for hypertensive bleed and the patient came in
acutely hypertensive at 240/120.

The patient was offered the option of a Factor VII trial, but he
refused. There were no other alternative therapies indicated.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] went to the neuro ICU for monitoring. His BP was
initially controlled with a labetalol gtt for a goal SBP &lt; 140,
and [**Known lastname **] and heparin products were held given the hemorrhage. His
exam improved, with increase in the strength of his left arm and
leg, and improvement in his dysarthria. Repeat imaging showed
that the hemorrhage was stable. He was transferred to the floor.

On the floor he worked with PT and OT who recommended acute
rehab. His BP was initally difficult to control, and required
titration of Captopril, Metoprolol, as well as addition of HCTZ.
SBP was controlled around 140 after titration to metoprolol
100mg tid, captopril 37.5 mg tid (then changed to lisinopril
20mg daily), and HCTZ 25 mg daily. His blood pressure was
controlled on discharge.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

cardiac catheterization with 2 Bare Metal Stents
central venous access placement with Swan-Ganz catheter
PICC placement
intra-aortic balloon pump placement
endotracheal tube intubation
left lower extremity fasciotomy
left lower extremity surgical debridement
IR Guided Tunneled Catheterization
IR Guided Dobhoff feeding tube
tracheotomy

Brief Hospital Course:

# Acute renal failure: Likely started before presentation to
[**Hospital1 18**] from poor forward flow from initial cardiogenic failure
and probably exacerbated by 320 ccs of contrast recieved in cath
lab.  She developed muddy brown casts on urine analysis. Due to
hyperkalemia to 6.8 and anuria immediately post cath, she was
treated with CVVHD for volume overload and hyperkalemia.  She
failed repeated trials off of CRRT.  Eventually it was felt that
she no longer required volume removal and she tolerated
intermittent HD without pressors.  Likely now dialysis-dependent
with oliguria, however renal consultants believe that urine
output should be followed closely as she continues to have
potential to regain renal function.

Discharge Instructions:

Mrs. [**Known lastname 28942**] required mechanical ventilation for respiratory
failure.  Because she was intubated for a prolonged time, a
tracheostomy was placed with a special valve so she could talk
through her tracheostomy hole.

Additionally, her hospital course was complicated by acute renal
failure.  She required regular dialysis during her
hospitalization and it is felt that she will be dependent on
dialysis from this point.

History of Present Illness:

Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old female with previous medical
history significant for DM2, HTN/HL, and diverticulosis.  She
initially presented to [**Hospital6 19155**] on [**12-27**] with 3
weeks of crampy abdominal pain.  Initial pain control with
Dilaudid and nausea control with Zofran + Reglan. CT abdomen
showed ?diverticular abscess and he was started on
Levaquin/Flagyl initially. She had a leukocytosis to 25 and
hypotension requiring neosyneprhine. Given her worsening
picture, she was brought to the OR for an exploratory
laparotomy.

A necrotic uterus was found and Ob-Gyn was called in for a
sub-total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy and
omentectomy were performed.  They found a pocket of pus/abscess
adjacent to uterus (walled off).  No fistula, no diverticulitis.
Omentectomy done "just in case it was cancer".  They closed the
fascia, placed a JP, left SQ tissue open.  She was given FFP and
10mg vitamin K IV intra-op for an INR of 1.6--&gt;1.4.
Peri-operative EBL~500cc and follow-up hematocrit went from 26
to 24.   She no longer required pressors post-operatively, but
remained intubated due desaturation to 85% on 4L, corrected to
100% on NRB presumably secondary to pulmonary edema (confirmed
by CXR) so she was given lasix 100mg IV with 1650cc output.
Prior to transfer, she was reportedly given 1 unit pRBCs
followed by Lasix.  Antibiotic coverage broadened with
Zosyn/Flagyl/Levaquin with blood cultures growing GNRs and GPCs
in [**4-17**] bottles and GNRs in urine culture.  An arterial line is
in place with a right double-lumen PICC.  She was sedated on
propofol. She has a partially open abdomen, packed with
betadine/gauze and with a JP drain in place (drained 20cc of
serosanguinous fluid to date).

Brief Hospital Course:

71 year old female with history of DM2, HL, and diverticulitis
s/p subtotal hysterectomy and bilateral oopherectomy for a
necrotic uterus and associated abscess, presenting with GNR/GPC
bacteremia concerning for polymicrobial sepsis.

DISPO: Patient evaluated by PT who recommended dispo to rehab
for continued recovery.  This was arranged and patient prepared
for d/c [**1-9**].

At the time of discharge on [**1-9**], the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating w assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain
was well controlled.

Discharge Instructions:

You were admitted to the hospital after you had an exploratory
lapartomy for a ? ruptured uterus. You developed  an abscess
near your surgery site and became very ill.  You were
transferred here for further managment.  You were takne to the
operating room where you found to have a perforated
diverticulitis with pelvic peritonitis.  You had a section of
your colon resected and had a colostomy placed. You are slowly
getting better.  You vital signs are stable and your white blood
cell count is decreasing. You are now on intravenous
antibiotics. You had a special dressing called a VAC dressing
over the incision to help with wound healing.  You are now
preparing for discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:

Ms. [**Known lastname 70382**] was admitted to the surgical service for a
scheduled thyroidectomy, intra-operatively she was found to have
an advanced aggressive thyroid cancer with invasion of the
tracheal and pharynx, final pathology revealed poorly
differentiated carcinoma, favor follicular carcinoma, T3/T4.
Post-operatively she was extubated but developed respiratory
distress and stridor; POD 2 she underwent a  flexible
bronchoscopy and placement of 8-0 Portex tracheostomy tube.
Endocrinology and oncology service were consulted, a CT scan
demonstrated no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy;
there was a retroperitoneal enhancing mass, no bone lesions
suspicious for malignancy, and a right hepatic lesion was also
seen. The retroperitoneal mass was biopsied prior to discharge
home with pathology results pending. She was to follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], oncologist on [**6-27**] to discuss chemotherapy
treatment options.

POD [**4-1**], she was extubated without difficulty and oxygenating
well on humidified tracheostomy collar, she was evaluated by
speech and swallow therapy and did not demonstrate signs or
symptoms of aspiration, her diet was slowly advanced to regular
with thin liquids and pills to be taken with whole liquids which
she tolerated well. She was also evaluated for a Passy-Muir
valve; she was unable to tolerate the placement and was found to
have increase tracheal pressures and reported difficulty
exhaling, she was to follow-up as an out-patient for
re-evaluation of the PMV.

She was discharged home in stable condition on [**6-14**] with
visiting nurse services and home respiratory care, all oxygen
supplies were to be delivered to her home. She was tolerating a
regular diet, afebrile, voiding without difficulty, and
ambulating independently. Her pain was well controlled with
Percocet. She was to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**1-1**]
weeks, oncology [**6-27**], and speech and swallow therapy in [**1-1**]
weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:

#. Mucosal bleeding: thrombocytopenia, stable.
He was noted to have bleeding from his gums/nose on [**2157-2-21**] and
ENT was consulted.  He was found to have left nasal septal
bleeding for which a packing was placed.  It was able to be
removed 5 days later.  Aminocaproic acid was used for gum
bleeding.  Mr. [**Known lastname 88075**] has several reasons to have low platelets;
ESLD, splenomegaly (19.3 cm), critical illness, and multiple
antibiotics that are reversibly myelosuppressive.  His bleeding
diathesis is related less to his elevated INR (a completely
unreliable predictor of bleeding in cirrhosis) and more to his
platelet count.  His platelet count was as low as 45K (when he
was found to be bleeding) and he required a total of 6 units of
pRBCs.  His platelets remained in the 80s-100s with no more
spontaneous bleeding.  As part of his twice-weekly labs, CBC
should be checked and he should receive platelet transfusion if
&lt;60.

Discharge Instructions:

During your stay, you have had pneumonia a couple of times, for
which you were given antibiotics.  You have a lot of secretions
in your lungs which intermittently causes your oxygen saturation
to get worse if a mucus plug temporarily blocks one of your
smaller airways.  You have also had some small collapse of the
lower parts of your lungs from not breathing deeply for a long
period of time.  For these reasons, it is very important for you
to keep up as much physical activity as possible and have some
chest physical therapy as well, which will improve your lungs
and breathing.
